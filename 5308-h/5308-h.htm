    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. ONLY THE GUARDIAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      American tourists, sure appreciators of all that is ancient and
      picturesque in England, invariably come to a halt, holding their breath in
      a sudden catch of wonder, as they pass through the half-ruinous gateway
      which admits to the Close of Wrychester. Nowhere else in England is there
      a fairer prospect of old-world peace. There before their eyes, set in the
      centre of a great green sward, fringed by tall elms and giant beeches,
      rises the vast fabric of the thirteenth-century Cathedral, its high spire
      piercing the skies in which rooks are for ever circling and calling. The
      time-worn stone, at a little distance delicate as lacework, is transformed
      at different hours of the day into shifting shades of colour, varying from
      grey to purple: the massiveness of the great nave and transepts contrasts
      impressively with the gradual tapering of the spire, rising so high above
      turret and clerestory that it at last becomes a mere line against the
      ether. In morning, as in afternoon, or in evening, here is a perpetual
      atmosphere of rest; and not around the great church alone, but in the
      quaint and ancient houses which fence in the Close. Little less old than
      the mighty mass of stone on which their ivy-framed windows look, these
      houses make the casual observer feel that here, if anywhere in the world,
      life must needs run smoothly. Under those high gables, behind those
      mullioned windows, in the beautiful old gardens lying between the stone
      porches and the elm-shadowed lawn, nothing, one would think, could
      possibly exist but leisured and pleasant existence: even the busy streets
      of the old city, outside the crumbling gateway, seem, for the moment, far
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of the oldest of these houses, half hidden behind trees and shrubs
      in a corner of the Close, three people sat at breakfast one fine May
      morning. The room in which they sat was in keeping with the old house and
      its surroundings&mdash;a long, low-ceilinged room, with oak panelling
      around its walls, and oak beams across its roof&mdash;a room of old
      furniture, and, old pictures, and old books, its antique atmosphere
      relieved by great masses of flowers, set here and there in old china
      bowls: through its wide windows, the casements of which were thrown wide
      open, there was an inviting prospect of a high-edged flower garden, and,
      seen in vistas through the trees and shrubberies, of patches of the west
      front of the Cathedral, now sombre and grey in shadow. But on the garden
      and into this flower-scented room the sun was shining gaily through the
      trees, and making gleams of light on the silver and china on the table and
      on the faces of the three people who sat around it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of these three, two were young, and the third was one of those men whose
      age it is never easy to guess&mdash;a tall, clean-shaven, bright-eyed,
      alert-looking man, good-looking in a clever, professional sort of way, a
      man whom no one could have taken for anything but a member of one of the
      learned callings. In some lights he looked no more than forty: a strong
      light betrayed the fact that his dark hair had a streak of grey in it, and
      was showing a tendency to whiten about the temples. A strong,
      intellectually superior man, this, scrupulously groomed and well-dressed,
      as befitted what he really was&mdash;a medical practitioner with an
      excellent connection amongst the exclusive society of a cathedral town.
      Around him hung an undeniable air of content and prosperity&mdash;as he
      turned over a pile of letters which stood by his plate, or glanced at the
      morning newspaper which lay at his elbow, it was easy to see that he had
      no cares beyond those of the day, and that they&mdash;so far as he knew
      then&mdash;were not likely to affect him greatly. Seeing him in these
      pleasant domestic circumstances, at the head of his table, with abundant
      evidences of comfort and refinement and modest luxury about him, any one
      would have said, without hesitation, that Dr. Mark Ransford was undeniably
      one of the fortunate folk of this world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second person of the three was a boy of apparently seventeen&mdash;a
      well-built, handsome lad of the senior schoolboy type, who was devoting
      himself in business-like fashion to two widely-differing pursuits&mdash;one,
      the consumption of eggs and bacon and dry toast; the other, the study of a
      Latin textbook, which he had propped up in front of him against the
      old-fashioned silver cruet. His quick eyes wandered alternately between
      his book and his plate; now and then he muttered a line or two to himself.
      His companions took no notice of these combinations of eating and
      learning: they knew from experience that it was his way to make up at
      breakfast-time for the moments he had stolen from his studies the night
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not difficult to see that the third member of the party, a girl of
      nineteen or twenty, was the boy's sister. Each had a wealth of brown hair,
      inclining, in the girl's case to a shade that had tints of gold in it;
      each had grey eyes, in which there was a mixture of blue; each had a
      bright, vivid colour; each was undeniably good-looking and eminently
      healthy. No one would have doubted that both had lived a good deal of an
      open-air existence: the boy was already muscular and sinewy: the girl
      looked as if she was well acquainted with the tennis racket and the
      golf-stick. Nor would any one have made the mistake of thinking that these
      two were blood relations of the man at the head of the table&mdash;between
      them and him there was not the least resemblance of feature, of colour, or
      of manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the boy learnt the last lines of his Latin, and the doctor turned
      over the newspaper, the girl read a letter&mdash;evidently, from the large
      sprawling handwriting, the missive of some girlish correspondent. She was
      deep in it when, from one of the turrets of the Cathedral, a bell began to
      ring. At that, she glanced at her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's Martin, Dick!" she said. "You'll have to hurry."
    </p>
    <p>
      Many a long year before that, in one of the bygone centuries, a worthy
      citizen of Wrychester, Martin by name, had left a sum of money to the Dean
      and Chapter of the Cathedral on condition that as long as ever the
      Cathedral stood, they should cause to be rung a bell from its smaller
      bell-tower for three minutes before nine o'clock every morning, all the
      year round. What Martin's object had been no one now knew&mdash;but this
      bell served to remind young gentlemen going to offices, and boys going to
      school, that the hour of their servitude was near. And Dick Bewery,
      without a word, bolted half his coffee, snatched up his book, grabbed at a
      cap which lay with more books on a chair close by, and vanished through
      the open window. The doctor laughed, laid aside his newspaper, and handed
      his cup across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think you need bother yourself about Dick's ever being late,
      Mary," he said. "You are not quite aware of the power of legs that are
      only seventeen years old. Dick could get to any given point in just about
      one-fourth of the time that I could, for instance&mdash;moreover, he has a
      cunning knowledge of every short cut in the city."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Bewery took the empty cup and began to refill it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't like him to be late," she remarked. "It's the beginning of bad
      habits."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well!" said Ransford indulgently. "He's pretty free from anything of
      that sort, you know. I haven't even suspected him of smoking, yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's because he thinks smoking would stop his growth and interfere with
      his cricket," answered Mary. "He would smoke if it weren't for that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's giving him high praise, then," said Ransford. "You couldn't give
      him higher! Know how to repress his inclinations. An excellent thing&mdash;and
      most unusual, I fancy. Most people&mdash;don't!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He took his refilled cup, rose from the table, and opened a box of
      cigarettes which stood on the mantelpiece. And the girl, instead of
      picking up her letter again, glanced at him a little doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That reminds me of&mdash;of something I wanted to say to you," she said.
      "You're quite right about people not repressing their inclinations. I&mdash;I
      wish some people would!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford turned quickly from the hearth and gave her a sharp look, beneath
      which her colour heightened. Her eyes shifted their gaze away to her
      letter, and she picked it up and began to fold it nervously. And at that
      Ransford rapped out a name, putting a quick suggestion of meaning inquiry
      into his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bryce?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl nodded her face showing distinct annoyance and dislike. Before
      saying more, Ransford lighted a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Been at it again?" he said at last. "Since last time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twice," she answered. "I didn't like to tell you&mdash;I've hated to
      bother you about it. But&mdash;what am I to do? I dislike him intensely&mdash;I
      can't tell why, but it's there, and nothing could ever alter the feeling.
      And though I told him&mdash;before&mdash;that it was useless&mdash;he
      mentioned it again&mdash;yesterday&mdash;at Mrs. Folliot's garden-party."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Confound his impudence!" growled Ransford. "Oh, well!&mdash;I'll have to
      settle with him myself. It's useless trifling with anything like that. I
      gave him a quiet hint before. And since he won't take it&mdash;all right!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;what shall you do?" she asked anxiously. "Not&mdash;send him
      away?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he's any decency about him, he'll go&mdash;after what I say to him,"
      answered Ransford. "Don't you trouble yourself about it&mdash;I'm not at
      all keen about him. He's a clever enough fellow, and a good assistant, but
      I don't like him, personally&mdash;never did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to think that anything that I say should lose him his
      situation&mdash;or whatever you call it," she remarked slowly. "That would
      seem&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No need to bother," interrupted Ransford. "He'll get another in two
      minutes&mdash;so to speak. Anyway, we can't have this going on. The fellow
      must be an ass! When I was young&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short at that, and turning away, looked out across the garden
      as if some recollection had suddenly struck him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you were young&mdash;which is, of course, such an awfully long time
      since!" said the girl, a little teasingly. "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only that if a woman said No&mdash;unmistakably&mdash;once, a man took it
      as final," replied Ransford. "At least&mdash;so I was always given to
      believe. Nowadays&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You forget that Mr. Pemberton Bryce is what most people would call a very
      pushing young man," said Mary. "If he doesn't get what he wants in this
      world, it won't be for not asking for it. But&mdash;if you must speak to
      him&mdash;and I really think you must!&mdash;will you tell him that he is
      not going to get&mdash;me? Perhaps he'll take it finally from you&mdash;as
      my guardian."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know if parents and guardians count for much in these degenerate
      days," said Ransford. "But&mdash;I won't have him annoying you. And&mdash;I
      suppose it has come to annoyance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's very annoying to be asked three times by a man whom you've told
      flatly, once for all, that you don't want him, at any time, ever!" she
      answered. "It's&mdash;irritating!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," said Ransford quietly. "I'll speak to him. There's going to
      be no annoyance for you under this roof."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl gave him a quick glance, and Ransford turned away from her and
      picked up his letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," she said. "But&mdash;there's no need to tell me that, because
      I know it already. Now I wonder if you'll tell me something more?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford turned back with a sudden apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" he asked brusquely. "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When are you going to tell me all about&mdash;Dick and myself?" she
      asked. "You promised that you would, you know, some day. And&mdash;a whole
      year's gone by since then. And&mdash;Dick's seventeen! He won't be
      satisfied always&mdash;just to know no more than that our father and
      mother died when we were very little, and that you've been guardian&mdash;and
      all that you have been!&mdash;to us. Will he, now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford laid down his letters again, and thrusting his hands in his
      pockets, squared his shoulders against the mantelpiece. "Don't you think
      you might wait until you're twenty-one?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" she said, with a laugh. "I'm just twenty&mdash;do you really think
      I shall be any wiser in twelve months? Of course I shan't!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't know that," he replied. "You may be&mdash;a great deal wiser."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what has that got to do with it?" she persisted. "Is there any reason
      why I shouldn't be told&mdash;everything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was looking at him with a certain amount of demand&mdash;and Ransford,
      who had always known that some moment of this sort must inevitably come,
      felt that she was not going to be put off with ordinary excuses. He
      hesitated&mdash;and she went on speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know," she continued, almost pleadingly. "We don't know anything&mdash;at
      all. I never have known, and until lately Dick has been too young to care&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has he begun asking questions?" demanded Ransford hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once or twice, lately&mdash;yes," replied Mary. "It's only natural." She
      laughed a little&mdash;a forced laugh. "They say," she went on, "that it
      doesn't matter, nowadays, if you can't tell who your grandfather was&mdash;but,
      just think, we don't know who our father was&mdash;except that his name
      was John Bewery. That doesn't convey much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know more," said Ransford. "I told you&mdash;always have told you&mdash;that
      he was an early friend of mine, a man of business, who, with your mother,
      died young, and I, as their friend, became guardian to you and Dick. Is&mdash;is
      there anything much more that I could tell?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's something I should very much like to know&mdash;personally," she
      answered, after a pause which lasted so long that Ransford began to feel
      uncomfortable under it. "Don't be angry&mdash;or hurt&mdash;if I tell you
      plainly what it is. I'm quite sure it's never even occurred to Dick&mdash;but
      I'm three years ahead of him. It's this&mdash;have we been dependent on
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford's face flushed and he turned deliberately to the window, and for
      a moment stood staring out on his garden and the glimpses of the
      Cathedral. And just as deliberately as he had turned away, he turned back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" he said. "Since you ask me, I'll tell you that. You've both got
      money&mdash;due to you when you're of age. It&mdash;it's in my hands. Not
      a great lot&mdash;but sufficient to&mdash;to cover all your expenses.
      Education&mdash;everything. When you're twenty-one, I'll hand over yours&mdash;when
      Dick's twenty-one, his. Perhaps I ought to have told you all that before,
      but&mdash;I didn't think it necessary. I&mdash;I dare say I've a tendency
      to let things slide."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've never let things slide about us," she replied quickly, with a
      sudden glance which made him turn away again. "And I only wanted to know&mdash;because
      I'd got an idea that&mdash;well, that we were owing everything to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not from me!" he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;that would never be!" she said. "But&mdash;don't you understand?
      I&mdash;wanted to know&mdash;something. Thank you. I won't ask more now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've always meant to tell you&mdash;a good deal," remarked Ransford,
      after another pause. "You see, I can scarcely&mdash;yet&mdash;realize that
      you're both growing up! You were at school a year ago. And Dick is still
      very young. Are&mdash;are you more satisfied now?" he went on anxiously.
      "If not&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm quite satisfied," she answered. "Perhaps&mdash;some day&mdash;you'll
      tell me more about our father and mother?&mdash;but never mind even that
      now. You're sure you haven't minded my asking&mdash;what I have asked?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course not&mdash;of course not!" he said hastily. "I ought to have
      remembered. And&mdash;but we'll talk again. I must get into the surgery&mdash;and
      have a word with Bryce, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you could only make him see reason and promise not to offend again,"
      she said. "Wouldn't that solve the difficulty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford shook his head and made no answer. He picked up his letters again
      and went out, and down a long stone-walled passage which led to his
      surgery at the side of the house. He was alone there when he had shut the
      door&mdash;and he relieved his feelings with a deep groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven help me if the lad ever insists on the real truth and on having
      proofs and facts given to him!" he muttered. "I shouldn't mind telling
      her, when she's a bit older&mdash;but he wouldn't understand as she would.
      Anyway, thank God I can keep up the pleasant fiction about the money
      without her ever knowing that I told her a deliberate lie just now. But&mdash;what's
      in the future? Here's one man to be dismissed already, and there'll be
      others, and one of them will be the favoured man. That man will have to be
      told! And&mdash;so will she, then. And&mdash;my God! she doesn't see, and
      mustn't see, that I'm madly in love with her myself! She's no idea of it&mdash;and
      she shan't have; I must&mdash;must continue to be&mdash;only the
      guardian!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed a little cynically as he laid his letters down on his desk and
      proceeded to open them&mdash;in which occupation he was presently
      interrupted by the opening of the side-door and the entrance of Mr.
      Pemberton Bryce.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. MAKING AN ENEMY
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was characteristic of Pemberton Bryce that he always walked into a room
      as if its occupant were asleep and he was afraid of waking him. He had a
      gentle step which was soft without being stealthy, and quiet movements
      which brought him suddenly to anybody's side before his presence was
      noticed. He was by Ransford's desk ere Ransford knew he was in the surgery&mdash;and
      Ransford's sudden realization of his presence roused a certain feeling of
      irritation in his mind, which he instantly endeavoured to suppress&mdash;it
      was no use getting cross with a man of whom you were about to rid
      yourself, he said to himself. And for the moment, after replying to his
      assistant's greeting&mdash;a greeting as quiet as his entrance&mdash;he
      went on reading his letters, and Bryce turned off to that part of the
      surgery in which the drugs were kept, and busied himself in making up some
      prescription. Ten minutes went by in silence; then Ransford pushed his
      correspondence aside, laid a paper-weight on it, and twisting his chair
      round, looked at the man to whom he was going to say some unpleasant
      things. Within himself he was revolving a question&mdash;how would Bryce
      take it?
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never liked this assistant of his, although he had then had him in
      employment for nearly two years. There was something about Pemberton Bryce
      which he did not understand and could not fathom. He had come to him with
      excellent testimonials and good recommendations; he was well up to his
      work, successful with patients, thoroughly capable as a general
      practitioner&mdash;there was no fault to be found with him on any
      professional grounds. But to Ransford his personality was objectionable&mdash;why,
      he was not quite sure. Outwardly, Bryce was rather more than presentable&mdash;a
      tall, good-looking man of twenty-eight or thirty, whom some people&mdash;women
      especially&mdash;would call handsome; he was the sort of young man who
      knows the value of good clothes and a smart appearance, and his
      professional manner was all that could be desired. But Ransford could not
      help distinguishing between Bryce the doctor and Bryce the man&mdash;and
      Bryce the man he did not like. Outside the professional part of him, Bryce
      seemed to him to be undoubtedly deep, sly, cunning&mdash;he conveyed the
      impression of being one of those men whose ears are always on the stretch,
      who take everything in and give little out. There was a curious air of
      watchfulness and of secrecy about him in private matters which was as
      repellent&mdash;to Ransford's thinking&mdash;as it was hard to explain.
      Anyway, in private affairs, he did not like his assistant, and he liked
      him less than ever as he glanced at him on this particular occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want a word with you," he said curtly. "I'd better say it now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce, who was slowly pouring some liquid from one bottle into another,
      looked quietly across the room and did not interrupt himself in his work.
      Ransford knew that he must have recognized a certain significance in the
      words just addressed to him&mdash;but he showed no outward sign of it, and
      the liquid went on trickling from one bottle to the other with the same
      uniform steadiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes?" said Bryce inquiringly. "One moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      He finished his task calmly, put the corks in the bottles, labelled one,
      restored the other to a shelf, and turned round. Not a man to be easily
      startled&mdash;not easily turned from a purpose, this, thought Ransford as
      he glanced at Bryce's eyes, which had a trick of fastening their gaze on
      people with an odd, disconcerting persistency.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry to say what I must say," he began. "But&mdash;you've brought it
      on yourself. I gave you a hint some time ago that your attentions were not
      welcome to Miss Bewery."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce made no immediate response. Instead, leaning almost carelessly and
      indifferently against the table at which he had been busy with drugs and
      bottles, he took a small file from his waistcoat pocket and began to
      polish his carefully cut nails.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes?" he said, after a pause. "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In spite of it," continued Ransford, "you've since addressed her again on
      the matter&mdash;not merely once, but twice."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce put his file away, and thrusting his hands in his pockets, crossed
      his feet as he leaned back against the table&mdash;his whole attitude
      suggesting, whether meaningly or not, that he was very much at his ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a great deal to be said on a point like this," he observed. "If a
      man wishes a certain young woman to become his wife, what right has any
      other man&mdash;or the young woman herself, for that matter to say that he
      mustn't express his desires to her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None," said Ransford, "provided he only does it once&mdash;and takes the
      answer he gets as final."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I disagree with you entirely," retorted Bryce. "On the last particular,
      at any rate. A man who considers any word of a woman's as being final is a
      fool. What a woman thinks on Monday she's almost dead certain not to think
      on Tuesday. The whole history of human relationship is on my side there.
      It's no opinion&mdash;it's a fact."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford stared at this frank remark, and Bryce went on, coolly and
      imperturbably, as if he had been discussing a medical problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man who takes a woman's first answer as final," he continued, "is, I
      repeat, a fool. There are lots of reasons why a woman shouldn't know her
      own mind at the first time of asking. She may be too surprised. She mayn't
      be quite decided. She may say one thing when she really means another.
      That often happens. She isn't much better equipped at the second time of
      asking. And there are women&mdash;young ones&mdash;who aren't really
      certain of themselves at the third time. All that's common sense."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll tell you what it is!" suddenly exclaimed Ransford, after remaining
      silent for a moment under this flow of philosophy. "I'm not going to
      discuss theories and ideas. I know one young woman, at any rate, who is
      certain of herself. Miss Bewery does not feel any inclination to you&mdash;now,
      nor at any time to be! She's told you so three times. And&mdash;you should
      take her answer and behave yourself accordingly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce favoured his senior with a searching look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How does Miss Bewery know that she mayn't be inclined to&mdash;in the
      future?" he asked. "She may come to regard me with favour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, she won't!" declared Ransford. "Better hear the truth, and be done
      with it. She doesn't like you&mdash;and she doesn't want to, either. Why
      can't you take your answer like a man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's your conception of a man?" asked Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That!&mdash;and a good one," exclaimed Ransford.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May satisfy you&mdash;but not me," said Bryce. "Mine's different. My
      conception of a man is of a being who's got some perseverance. You can get
      anything in this world&mdash;anything!&mdash;by pegging away for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're not going to get my ward," suddenly said Ransford. "That's flat!
      She doesn't want you&mdash;and she's now said so three times. And&mdash;I
      support her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have you against me?" asked Bryce calmly. "If, as you say, you
      support her in her resolution not to listen to my proposals, you must have
      something against me. What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a question you've no right to put," replied Ransford, "for it's
      utterly unnecessary. So I'm not going to answer it. I've nothing against
      you as regards your work&mdash;nothing! I'm willing to give you an
      excellent testimonial."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" remarked Bryce quietly. "That means&mdash;you wish me to go away?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I certainly think it would be best," said Ransford.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case," continued Bryce, more coolly than ever, "I shall certainly
      want to know what you have against me&mdash;or what Miss Bewery has
      against me. Why am I objected to as a suitor? You, at any rate, know who I
      am&mdash;you know that my father is of our own profession, and a man of
      reputation and standing, and that I myself came to you on high
      recommendation. Looked at from my standpoint, I'm a thoroughly eligible
      young man. And there's a point you forget&mdash;there's no mystery about
      me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford turned sharply in his chair as he noticed the emphasis which
      Bryce put on his last word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?" he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What I've just said," replied Bryce. "There's no mystery attaching to me.
      Any question about me can be answered. Now, you can't say that as regards
      your ward. That's a fact, Dr. Ransford."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford, in years gone by, had practised himself in the art of
      restraining his temper&mdash;naturally a somewhat quick one. And he made a
      strong effort in that direction now, recognizing that there was something
      behind his assistant's last remark, and that Bryce meant him to know it
      was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll repeat what I've just said," he answered. "What do you mean by
      that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hear things," said Bryce. "People will talk&mdash;even a doctor can't
      refuse to hear what gossiping and garrulous patients say. Since she came
      to you from school, a year ago, Wrychester people have been much
      interested in Miss Bewery, and in her brother, too. And there are a good
      many residents of the Close&mdash;you know their nice, inquisitive ways!&mdash;who
      want to know who the sister and brother really are&mdash;and what your
      relationship is to them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Confound their impudence!" growled Ransford.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By all means," agreed Bryce. "And&mdash;for all I care&mdash;let them be
      confounded, too. But if you imagine that the choice and select coteries of
      a cathedral town, consisting mainly of the relicts of deceased deans,
      canons, prebendaries and the like, and of maiden aunts, elderly spinsters,
      and tea-table-haunting curates, are free from gossip&mdash;why, you're a
      singularly innocent person!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They'd better not begin gossiping about my affairs," said Ransford.
      "Otherwise&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't stop them from gossiping about your affairs," interrupted Bryce
      cheerfully. "Of course they gossip about your affairs; have gossiped about
      them; will continue to gossip about them. It's human nature!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've heard them?" asked Ransford, who was too vexed to keep back his
      curiosity. "You yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you are aware, I am often asked out to tea," replied Bryce, "and to
      garden-parties, and tennis-parties, and choice and cosy functions
      patronized by curates and associated with crumpets. I have heard&mdash;with
      these ears. I can even repeat the sort of thing I have heard. 'That dear,
      delightful Miss Bewery&mdash;what a charming girl! And that good-looking
      boy, her brother&mdash;quite a dear! Now I wonder who they really are?
      Wards of Dr. Ransford, of course! Really, how very romantic!&mdash;and
      just a little&mdash;eh?&mdash;unusual? Such a comparatively young man to
      have such a really charming girl as his ward! Can't be more than
      forty-five himself, and she's twenty&mdash;how very, very romantic!
      Really, one would think there ought to be a chaperon!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn!" said Ransford under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so," agreed Bryce. "But&mdash;that's the sort of thing. Do you want
      more? I can supply an unlimited quantity in the piece if you like. But
      it's all according to sample."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So&mdash;in addition to your other qualities," remarked Ransford, "you're
      a gossiper?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce smiled slowly and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he replied. "I'm a listener. A good one, too. But do you see my
      point? I say&mdash;there's no mystery about me. If Miss Bewery will honour
      me with her hand, she'll get a man whose antecedents will bear the
      strictest investigation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you inferring that hers won't?" demanded Ransford.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not inferring anything," said Bryce. "I am speaking for myself, of
      myself. Pressing my own claim, if you like, on you, the guardian. You
      might do much worse than support my claims, Dr. Ransford."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Claims, man!" retorted Ransford. "You've got no claims! What are you
      talking about? Claims!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My pretensions, then," answered Bryce. "If there is a mystery&mdash;as
      Wrychester people say there is&mdash;about Miss Bewery, it would be safe
      with me. Whatever you may think, I'm a thoroughly dependable man&mdash;when
      it's in my own interest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And&mdash;when it isn't?" asked Ransford. "What are you then?&mdash;as
      you're so candid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could be a very bad enemy," replied Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's silence, during which the two men looked attentively
      at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've told you the truth," said Ransford at last. "Miss Bewery flatly
      refuses to entertain any idea whatever of ever marrying you. She earnestly
      hopes that that eventuality may never be mentioned to her again. Will you
      give me your word of honour to respect her wishes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" answered Bryce. "I won't!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?" asked Ransford, with a faint show of anger. "A woman's wishes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I may consider that I see signs of a changed mind in her," said
      Bryce. "That's why."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll never see any change of mind," declared Ransford. "That's certain.
      Is that your fixed determination?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is," answered Bryce. "I'm not the sort of man who is easily repelled."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, in that case," said Ransford, "we had better part company." He rose
      from his desk, and going over to a safe which stood in a corner, unlocked
      it and took some papers from an inside drawer. He consulted one of these
      and turned to Bryce. "You remember our agreement?" he continued. "Your
      engagement was to be determined by a three months' notice on either side,
      or, at my will, at any time by payment of three months' salary?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite right," agreed Bryce. "I remember, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I'll give you a cheque for three months' salary&mdash;now," said
      Ransford, and sat down again at his desk. "That will settle matters
      definitely&mdash;and, I hope, agreeably."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce made no reply. He remained leaning against the table, watching
      Ransford write the cheque. And when Ransford laid the cheque down at the
      edge of the desk he made no movement towards it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must see," remarked Ransford, half apologetically, "that it's the
      only thing I can do. I can't have any man who's not&mdash;not welcome to
      her, to put it plainly&mdash;causing any annoyance to my ward. I repeat,
      Bryce&mdash;you must see it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have nothing to do with what you see," answered Bryce. "Your opinions
      are not mine, and mine aren't yours. You're really turning me away&mdash;as
      if I were a dishonest foreman!&mdash;because in my opinion it would be a
      very excellent thing for her and for myself if Miss Bewery would consent
      to marry me. That's the plain truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford allowed himself to take a long and steady look at Bryce. The
      thing was done now, and his dismissed assistant seemed to be taking it
      quietly&mdash;and Ransford's curiosity was aroused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't make you out!" he exclaimed. "I don't know whether you're the
      most cynical young man I ever met, or whether you're the most obtuse&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not the last, anyway," interrupted Bryce. "I assure you of that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't you see for yourself, then, man, that the girl doesn't want you!"
      said Ransford. "Hang it!&mdash;for anything you know to the contrary, she
      may have&mdash;might have&mdash;other ideas!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce, who had been staring out of a side window for the last minute or
      two, suddenly laughed, and, lifting a hand, pointed into the garden. And
      Ransford turned&mdash;and saw Mary Bewery walking there with a tall lad,
      whom he recognized as one Sackville Bonham, stepson of Mr. Folliot, a
      wealthy resident of the Close. The two young people were laughing and
      chatting together with evident great friendliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps," remarked Bryce quietly, "her ideas run in&mdash;that direction?
      In which case, Dr. Ransford, you'll have trouble. For Mrs. Folliot, mother
      of yonder callow youth, who's the apple of her eye, is one of the
      inquisitive ladies of whom I've just told you, and if her son unites
      himself with anybody, she'll want to know exactly who that anybody is.
      You'd far better have supported me as an aspirant! However&mdash;I suppose
      there's no more to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing!" answered Ransford. "Except to say good-day&mdash;and good-bye
      to you. You needn't remain&mdash;I'll see to everything. And I'm going out
      now. I think you'd better not exchange any farewells with any one."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce nodded silently, and Ransford, picking up his hat and gloves, left
      the surgery by the side door. A moment later, Bryce saw him crossing the
      Close.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. ST. WRYTHA'S STAIR
    </h2>
    <p>
      The summarily dismissed assistant, thus left alone, stood for a moment in
      evident deep thought before he moved towards Ransford's desk and picked up
      the cheque. He looked at it carefully, folded it neatly, and put it away
      in his pocket-book; after that he proceeded to collect a few possessions
      of his own, instruments, books from various drawers and shelves. He was
      placing these things in a small hand-bag when a gentle tap sounded on the
      door by which patients approached the surgery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in!" he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no response, although the door was slightly ajar; instead, the
      knock was repeated, and at that Bryce crossed the room and flung the door
      open.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man stood outside&mdash;an elderly, slight-figured, quiet-looking man,
      who looked at Bryce with a half-deprecating, half-nervous air; the air of
      a man who was shy in manner and evidently fearful of seeming to intrude.
      Bryce's quick, observant eyes took him in at a glance, noting a much worn
      and lined face, thin grey hair and tired eyes; this was a man, he said to
      himself, who had seen trouble. Nevertheless, not a poor man, if his
      general appearance was anything to go by&mdash;he was well and even
      expensively dressed, in the style generally affected by well-to-do
      merchants and city men; his clothes were fashionably cut, his silk hat was
      new, his linen and boots irreproachable; a fine diamond pin gleamed in his
      carefully arranged cravat. Why, then, this unmistakably furtive and
      half-frightened manner&mdash;which seemed to be somewhat relieved at the
      sight of Bryce?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this&mdash;is Dr. Ransford within?" asked the stranger. "I was told
      this is his house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Ransford is out," replied Bryce. "Just gone out&mdash;not five
      minutes ago. This is his surgery. Can I be of use?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The man hesitated, looking beyond Bryce into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, thank you," he said at last. "I&mdash;no, I don't want professional
      services&mdash;I just called to see Dr. Ransford&mdash;I&mdash;the fact
      is, I once knew some one of that name. It's no matter&mdash;at present."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce stepped outside and pointed across the Close.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Ransford," he said, "went over there&mdash;I rather fancy he's gone
      to the Deanery&mdash;he has a case there. If you went through Paradise,
      you'd very likely meet him coming back&mdash;the Deanery is the big house
      in the far corner yonder."
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger followed Bryce's outstretched finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Paradise?" he said, wonderingly. "What's that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce pointed to a long stretch of grey wall which projected from the
      south wall of the Cathedral into the Close.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's an enclosure&mdash;between the south porch and the transept," he
      said. "Full of old tombs and trees&mdash;a sort of wilderness&mdash;why
      called Paradise I don't know. There's a short cut across it to the Deanery
      and that part of the Close&mdash;through that archway you see over there.
      If you go across, you're almost sure to meet Dr. Ransford."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm much obliged to you," said the stranger. "Thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned away in the direction which Bryce had indicated, and Bryce went
      back&mdash;only to go out again and call after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you don't meet him, shall I say you'll call again?" he asked. "And&mdash;what
      name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's immaterial," he answered. "I'll see him&mdash;somewhere&mdash;or
      later. Many thanks."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on his way towards Paradise, and Bryce returned to the surgery and
      completed his preparations for departure. And in the course of things, he
      more than once looked through the window into the garden and saw Mary
      Bewery still walking and talking with young Sackville Bonham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he muttered to himself. "I won't trouble to exchange any farewells&mdash;not
      because of Ransford's hint, but because there's no need. If Ransford
      thinks he's going to drive me out of Wrychester before I choose to go he's
      badly mistaken&mdash;it'll be time enough to say farewell when I take my
      departure&mdash;and that won't be just yet. Now I wonder who that old chap
      was? Knew some one of Ransford's name once, did he? Probably Ransford
      himself&mdash;in which case he knows more of Ransford than anybody in
      Wrychester knows&mdash;for nobody in Wrychester knows anything beyond a
      few years back. No, Dr. Ransford!&mdash;no farewells&mdash;to anybody! A
      mere departure&mdash;till I turn up again."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Bryce was not to get away from the old house without something in the
      nature of a farewell. As he walked out of the surgery by the side
      entrance, Mary Bewery, who had just parted from young Bonham in the garden
      and was about to visit her dogs in the stable yard, came along: she and
      Bryce met, face to face. The girl flushed, not so much from embarrassment
      as from vexation; Bryce, cool as ever, showed no sign of any
      embarrassment. Instead, he laughed, tapping the hand-bag which he carried
      under one arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Summarily turned out&mdash;as if I had been stealing the spoons," he
      remarked. "I go&mdash;with my small belongings. This is my first reward&mdash;for
      devotion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have nothing to say to you," answered Mary, sweeping by him with a
      highly displeased glance. "Except that you have brought it on yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very feminine retort!" observed Bryce. "But&mdash;there is no malice in
      it? Your anger won't last more than&mdash;shall we say a day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may say what you like," she replied. "As I just said, I have nothing
      to say&mdash;now or at any time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That remains to be proved," remarked Bryce. "The phrase is one of much
      elasticity. But for the present&mdash;I go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked out into the Close, and without as much as a backward look
      struck off across the sward in the direction in which, ten minutes before,
      he had sent the strange man. He had rooms in a quiet lane on the farther
      side of the Cathedral precinct, and his present intention was to go to
      them to leave his bag and make some further arrangements. He had no idea
      of leaving Wrychester&mdash;he knew of another doctor in the city who was
      badly in need of help: he would go to him&mdash;would tell him, if need
      be, why he had left Ransford. He had a multiplicity of schemes and ideas
      in his head, and he began to consider some of them as he stepped out of
      the Close into the ancient enclosure which all Wrychester folk knew by its
      time-honoured name of Paradise. This was really an outer court of the old
      cloisters; its high walls, half-ruinous, almost wholly covered with ivy,
      shut in an expanse of turf, liberally furnished with yew and cypress and
      studded with tombs and gravestones. In one corner rose a gigantic elm; in
      another a broken stairway of stone led to a doorway set high in the walls
      of the nave; across the enclosure itself was a pathway which led towards
      the houses in the south-east corner of the Close. It was a curious, gloomy
      spot, little frequented save by people who went across it rather than
      follow the gravelled paths outside, and it was untenanted when Bryce
      stepped into it. But just as he walked through the archway he saw
      Ransford. Ransford was emerging hastily from a postern door in the west
      porch&mdash;so hastily that Bryce checked himself to look at him. And
      though they were twenty yards apart, Bryce saw that Ransford's face was
      very pale, almost to whiteness, and that he was unmistakably agitated.
      Instantly he connected that agitation with the man who had come to the
      surgery door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They've met!" mused Bryce, and stopped, staring after Ransford's
      retreating figure. "Now what is it in that man's mere presence that's
      upset Ransford? He looks like a man who's had a nasty, unexpected shock&mdash;a
      bad 'un!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained standing in the archway, gazing after the retreating figure,
      until Ransford had disappeared within his own garden; still wondering and
      speculating, but not about his own affairs, he turned across Paradise at
      last and made his way towards the farther corner. There was a little
      wicket-gate there, set in the ivied wall; as Bryce opened it, a man in the
      working dress of a stone-mason, whom he recognized as being one of the
      master-mason's staff, came running out of the bushes. His face, too, was
      white, and his eyes were big with excitement. And recognizing Bryce, he
      halted, panting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, Varner?" asked Bryce calmly. "Something happened?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The man swept his hand across his forehead as if he were dazed, and then
      jerked his thumb over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man!" he gasped. "Foot of St. Wrytha's Stair there, doctor. Dead&mdash;or
      if not dead, near it. I saw it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce seized Varner's arm and gave it a shake.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You saw&mdash;what?" he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Saw him&mdash;fall. Or rather&mdash;flung!" panted Varner. "Somebody&mdash;couldn't
      see who, nohow&mdash;flung him right through yon doorway, up there. He
      fell right over the steps&mdash;crash!" Bryce looked over the tops of the
      yews and cypresses at the doorway in the clerestory to which Varner
      pointed&mdash;a low, open archway gained by the half-ruinous stair. It was
      forty feet at least from the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You saw him&mdash;thrown!" he exclaimed. "Thrown&mdash;down there?
      Impossible, man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell you I saw it!" asserted Varner doggedly. "I was looking at one of
      those old tombs yonder&mdash;somebody wants some repairs doing&mdash;and
      the jackdaws were making such a to-do up there by the roof I glanced up at
      them. And I saw this man thrown through that door&mdash;fairly flung
      through it! God!&mdash;do you think I could mistake my own eyes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you see who flung him?" asked Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I saw a hand&mdash;just for one second, as it might be&mdash;by the
      edge of the doorway," answered Varner. "I was more for watching him! He
      sort of tottered for a second on the step outside the door, turned over
      and screamed&mdash;I can hear it now!&mdash;and crashed down on the flags
      beneath."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long since?" demanded Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Five or six minutes," said Varner. "I rushed to him&mdash;I've been doing
      what I could. But I saw it was no good, so I was running for help&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce pushed him towards the bushes by which they were standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take me to him," he said. "Come on!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Varner turned back, making a way through the cypresses. He led Bryce to
      the foot of the great wall of the nave. There in the corner formed by the
      angle of nave and transept, on a broad pavement of flagstones, lay the
      body of a man crumpled up in a curiously twisted position. And with one
      glance, even before he reached it, Bryce knew what body it was&mdash;that
      of the man who had come, shyly and furtively, to Ransford's door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look!" exclaimed Varner, suddenly pointing. "He's stirring!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce, whose gaze was fastened on the twisted figure, saw a slight
      movement which relaxed as suddenly as it had occurred. Then came
      stillness. "That's the end!" he muttered. "The man's dead! I'll guarantee
      that before I put a hand on him. Dead enough!" he went on, as he reached
      the body and dropped on one knee by it. "His neck's broken."
    </p>
    <p>
      The mason bent down and looked, half-curiously, half-fearfully, at the
      dead man. Then he glanced upward&mdash;at the open door high above them in
      the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a fearful drop, that, sir," he said. "And he came down with such
      violence. You're sure it's over with him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He died just as we came up," answered Bryce. "That movement we saw was
      the last effort&mdash;involuntary, of course. Look here, Varner!&mdash;you'll
      have to get help. You'd better fetch some of the cathedral people&mdash;some
      of the vergers. No!" he broke off suddenly, as the low strains of an organ
      came from within the great building. "They're just beginning the morning
      service&mdash;of course, it's ten o'clock. Never mind them&mdash;go
      straight to the police. Bring them back&mdash;I'll stay here."
    </p>
    <p>
      The mason turned off towards the gateway of the Close, and while the
      strains of the organ grew louder, Bryce bent over the dead man, wondering
      what had really happened. Thrown from an open doorway in the clerestory
      over St. Wrytha's Stair?&mdash;it seemed almost impossible! But a sudden
      thought struck him: supposing two men, wishing to talk in privacy
      unobserved, had gone up into the clerestory of the Cathedral&mdash;as they
      easily could, by more than one door, by more than one stair&mdash;and
      supposing they had quarrelled, and one of them had flung or pushed the
      other through the door above&mdash;what then? And on the heels of that
      thought hurried another&mdash;this man, now lying dead, had come to the
      surgery, seeking Ransford, and had subsequently gone away, presumably in
      search of him, and Bryce himself had just seen Ransford, obviously
      agitated and pale of cheek, leaving the west porch; what did it all mean?
      what was the apparently obvious inference to be drawn? Here was the
      stranger dead&mdash;and Varner was ready to swear that he had seen him
      thrown, flung violently, through the door forty feet above. That was&mdash;murder!
      Then&mdash;who was the murderer?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce looked carefully and narrowly around him. Now that Varner had gone
      away, there was not a human being in sight, nor anywhere near, so far as
      he knew. On one side of him and the dead man rose the grey walls of nave
      and transept; on the other, the cypresses and yews rising amongst the old
      tombs and monuments. Assuring himself that no one was near, no eye
      watching, he slipped his hand into the inner breast pocket of the dead
      man's smart morning coat. Such a man must carry papers&mdash;papers would
      reveal something. And Bryce wanted to know anything&mdash;anything that
      would give information and let him into whatever secret there might be
      between this unlucky stranger and Ransford.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the breast pocket was empty; there was no pocket-book there; there
      were no papers there. Nor were there any papers elsewhere in the other
      pockets which he hastily searched: there was not even a card with a name
      on it. But he found a purse, full of money&mdash;banknotes, gold, silver&mdash;and
      in one of its compartments a scrap of paper folded curiously, after the
      fashion of the cocked-hat missives of another age in which envelopes had
      not been invented. Bryce hurriedly unfolded this, and after one glance at
      its contents, made haste to secrete it in his own pocket. He had only just
      done this and put back the purse when he heard Varner's voice, and a
      second later the voice of Inspector Mitchington, a well-known police
      official. And at that Bryce sprang to his feet, and when the mason and his
      companions emerged from the bushes was standing looking thoughtfully at
      the dead man. He turned to Mitchington with a shake of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dead!" he said in a hushed voice. "Died as we got to him. Broken&mdash;all
      to pieces, I should say&mdash;neck and spine certainly. I suppose Varner's
      told you what he saw."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington, a sharp-eyed, dark-complexioned man, quick of movement,
      nodded, and after one glance at the body, looked up at the open doorway
      high above them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That the door?" he asked, turning to Varner. "And&mdash;it was open?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's always open," answered Varner. "Least-ways, it's been open, like
      that, all this spring, to my knowledge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is there behind it?" inquired Mitchington.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sort of gallery, that runs all round the nave," replied Varner.
      "Clerestory gallery&mdash;that's what it is. People can go up there and
      walk around&mdash;lots of 'em do&mdash;tourists, you know. There's two or
      three ways up to it&mdash;staircases in the turrets."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington turned to one of the two constables who had followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let Varner show you the way up there," he said. "Go quietly&mdash;don't
      make any fuss&mdash;the morning service is just beginning. Say nothing to
      anybody&mdash;just take a quiet look around, along that gallery,
      especially near the door there&mdash;and come back here." He looked down
      at the dead man again as the mason and the constable went away. "A
      stranger, I should think, doctor&mdash;tourist, most likely. But&mdash;thrown
      down! That man Varner is positive. That looks like foul play."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, there's no doubt of that!" asserted Bryce. "You'll have to go into
      that pretty deeply. But the inside of the Cathedral's like a
      rabbit-warren, and whoever threw the man through that doorway no doubt
      knew how to slip away unobserved. Now, you'll have to remove the body to
      the mortuary, of course&mdash;but just let me fetch Dr. Ransford first.
      I'd like some other medical man than myself to see him before he's moved&mdash;I'll
      have him here in five minutes."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned away through the bushes and emerging upon the Close ran across
      the lawns in the direction of the house which he had left not twenty
      minutes before. He had but one idea as he ran&mdash;he wanted to see
      Ransford face to face with the dead man&mdash;wanted to watch him, to
      observe him, to see how he looked, how he behaved. Then he, Bryce, would
      know&mdash;something.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was to know something before that. He opened the door of the
      surgery suddenly, but with his usual quietness of touch. And on the
      threshold he paused. Ransford, the very picture of despair, stood just
      within, his face convulsed, beating one hand upon the other.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. THE ROOM AT THE MITRE
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the few seconds which elapsed before Ransford recognized Bryce's
      presence, Bryce took a careful, if swift, observation of his late
      employer. That Ransford was visibly upset by something was plain enough to
      see; his face was still pale, he was muttering to himself, one clenched
      fist was pounding the open palm of the other hand&mdash;altogether, he
      looked like a man who is suddenly confronted with some fearful difficulty.
      And when Bryce, having looked long enough to satisfy his wishes, coughed
      gently, he started in such a fashion as to suggest that his nerves had
      become unstrung.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?&mdash;what are you doing there?" he demanded almost fiercely.
      "What do you mean by coming in like that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce affected to have seen nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I came to fetch you," he answered. "There's been an accident in Paradise&mdash;man
      fallen from that door at the head of St. Wrytha's Stair. I wish you'd come&mdash;but
      I may as well tell you that he's past help&mdash;dead!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dead! A man?" exclaimed Ransford. "What man? A workman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce had already made up his mind about telling Ransford of the
      stranger's call at the surgery. He would say nothing&mdash;at that time at
      any rate. It was improbable that any one but himself knew of the call; the
      side entrance to the surgery was screened from the Close by a shrubbery;
      it was very unlikely that any passer-by had seen the man call or go away.
      No&mdash;he would keep his knowledge secret until it could be made better
      use of.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a workman&mdash;not a townsman&mdash;a stranger," he answered. "Looks
      like a well-to-do tourist. A slightly-built, elderly man&mdash;grey-haired."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford, who had turned to his desk to master himself, looked round with
      a sudden sharp glance&mdash;and for the moment Bryce was taken aback. For
      he had condemned Ransford&mdash;and yet that glance was one of apparently
      genuine surprise, a glance which almost convinced him, against his will,
      against only too evident facts, that Ransford was hearing of the Paradise
      affair for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An elderly man&mdash;grey-haired&mdash;slightly built?" said Ransford.
      "Dark clothes&mdash;silk hat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely," replied Bryce, who was now considerably astonished. "Do you
      know him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw such a man entering the Cathedral, a while ago," answered Ransford.
      "A stranger, certainly. Come along, then."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had fully recovered his self-possession by that time, and he led the
      way from the surgery and across the Close as if he were going on an
      ordinary professional visit. He kept silence as they walked rapidly
      towards Paradise, and Bryce was silent, too. He had studied Ransford a
      good deal during their two years' acquaintanceship, and he knew Ransford's
      power of repressing and commanding his feelings and concealing his
      thoughts. And now he decided that the look and start which he had at first
      taken to be of the nature of genuine astonishment were cunningly assumed,
      and he was not surprised when, having reached the group of men gathered
      around the body, Ransford showed nothing but professional interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you done anything towards finding out who this unfortunate man is?"
      asked Ransford, after a brief examination, as he turned to Mitchington.
      "Evidently a stranger&mdash;but he probably has papers on him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's nothing on him&mdash;except a purse, with plenty of money in it,"
      answered Mitchington. "I've been through his pockets myself: there isn't a
      scrap of paper&mdash;not even as much as an old letter. But he's evidently
      a tourist, or something of the sort, and so he'll probably have stayed in
      the city all night, and I'm going to inquire at the hotels."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There'll be an inquest, of course," remarked Ransford mechanically. "Well&mdash;we
      can do nothing, Mitchington. You'd better have the body removed to the
      mortuary." He turned and looked up the broken stairway at the foot of
      which they were standing. "You say he fell down that?" he asked. "Whatever
      was he doing up there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington looked at Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't you told Dr. Ransford how it was?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," answered Bryce. He glanced at Ransford, indicating Varner, who had
      come back with the constable and was standing by. "He didn't fall," he
      went on, watching Ransford narrowly. "He was violently flung out of that
      doorway. Varner here saw it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford's cheek flushed, and he was unable to repress a slight start. He
      looked at the mason.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You actually saw it!" he exclaimed. "Why, what did you see?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Him!" answered Varner, nodding at the dead man. "Flung, head and heels,
      clean through that doorway up there. Hadn't a chance to save himself, he
      hadn't! Just grabbed at&mdash;nothing!&mdash;and came down. Give a year's
      wages if I hadn't seen it&mdash;and heard him scream."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford was watching Varner with a set, concentrated look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who&mdash;flung him?" he asked suddenly. "You say you saw!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aye, sir, but not as much as all that!" replied the mason. "I just saw a
      hand&mdash;and that was all. But," he added, turning to the police with a
      knowing look, "there's one thing I can swear to&mdash;it was a gentleman's
      hand! I saw the white shirt cuff and a bit of a black sleeve!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford turned away. But he just as suddenly turned back to the
      inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll have to let the Cathedral authorities know, Mitchington," he said.
      "Better get the body removed, though, first&mdash;do it now before the
      morning service is over. And&mdash;let me hear what you find out about his
      identity, if you can discover anything in the city."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went away then, without another word or a further glance at the dead
      man. But Bryce had already assured himself of what he was certain was a
      fact&mdash;that a look of unmistakable relief had swept across Ransford's
      face for the fraction of a second when he knew that there were no papers
      on the dead man. He himself waited after Ransford had gone; waited until
      the police had fetched a stretcher, when he personally superintended the
      removal of the body to the mortuary outside the Close. And there a
      constable who had come over from the police-station gave a faint hint as
      to further investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw that poor gentleman last night, sir," he said to the inspector. "He
      was standing at the door of the Mitre, talking to another gentleman&mdash;a
      tallish man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I'll go across there," said Mitchington. "Come with me, if you like,
      Dr. Bryce."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was precisely what Bryce desired&mdash;he was already anxious to
      acquire all the information he could get. And he walked over the way with
      the inspector, to the quaint old-world inn which filled almost one side of
      the little square known as Monday Market, and in at the courtyard, where,
      looking out of the bow window which had served as an outer bar in the
      coaching days, they found the landlady of the Mitre, Mrs. Partingley.
      Bryce saw at once that she had heard the news.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's this, Mr. Mitchington?" she demanded as they drew near across the
      cobble-paved yard. "Somebody's been in to say there's been an accident to
      a gentleman, a stranger&mdash;I hope it isn't one of the two we've got in
      the house?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should say it is, ma'am," answered the inspector. "He was seen outside
      here last night by one of our men, anyway."
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlady uttered an expression of distress, and opening a side-door,
      motioned them to step into her parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which of them is it?" she asked anxiously. "There's two&mdash;came
      together last night, they did&mdash;a tall one and a short one. Dear, dear
      me!&mdash;is it a bad accident, now, inspector?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The man's dead, ma'am," replied Mitchington grimly. "And we want to know
      who he is. Have you got his name&mdash;and the other gentleman's?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Partingley uttered another exclamation of distress and astonishment,
      lifting her plump hands in horror. But her business faculties remained
      alive, and she made haste to produce a big visitors' book and to spread it
      open before her callers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There it is!" she said, pointing to the two last entries. "That's the
      short gentleman's name&mdash;Mr. John Braden, London. And that's the tall
      one's&mdash;Mr. Christopher Dellingham&mdash;also London. Tourists, of
      course&mdash;we've never seen either of them before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Came together, you say, Mrs. Partingley?" asked Mitchington. "When was
      that, now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just before dinner, last night," answered the landlady. "They'd evidently
      come in by the London train&mdash;that gets in at six-forty, as you know.
      They came here together, and they'd dinner together, and spent the evening
      together. Of course, we took them for friends. But they didn't go out
      together this morning, though they'd breakfast together. After breakfast,
      Mr. Dellingham asked me the way to the old Manor Mill, and he went off
      there, so I concluded. Mr. Braden, he hung about a bit, studying a local
      directory I'd lent him, and after a while he asked me if he could hire a
      trap to take him out to Saxonsteade this afternoon. Of course, I said he
      could, and he arranged for it to be ready at two-thirty. Then he went out,
      and across the market towards the Cathedral. And that," concluded Mrs.
      Partingley, "is about all I know, gentlemen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Saxonsteade, eh?" remarked Mitchington. "Did he say anything about his
      reasons for going there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, yes, he did," replied the landlady. "For he asked me if I thought
      he'd be likely to find the Duke at home at that time of day. I said I knew
      his Grace was at Saxonsteade just now, and that I should think the middle
      of the afternoon would be a good time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He didn't tell you his business with the Duke?" asked Mitchington.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a word!" said the landlady. "Oh, no!&mdash;just that, and no more.
      But&mdash;here's Mr. Dellingham."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce turned to see a tall, broad-shouldered, bearded man pass the window&mdash;the
      door opened and he walked in, to glance inquisitively at the inspector. He
      turned at once to Mrs. Partingley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hear there's been an accident to that gentleman I came in with last
      night?" he said. "Is it anything serious? Your ostler says&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "These gentlemen have just come about it, sir," answered the landlady. She
      glanced at Mitchington. "Perhaps you'll tell&mdash;" she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was he a friend of yours, sir?" asked Mitchington. "A personal friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never saw him in my life before last night!" replied the tall man. "We
      just chanced to meet in the train coming down from London, got talking,
      and discovered we were both coming to the same place&mdash;Wrychester. So&mdash;we
      came to this house together. No&mdash;no friend of mine&mdash;not even an
      acquaintance&mdash;previous, of course, to last night. Is&mdash;is it
      anything serious?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's dead, sir," replied Mitchington. "And now we want to know who he
      is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God bless my soul! Dead? You don't say so!" exclaimed Mr. Dellingham.
      "Dear, dear! Well, I can't help you&mdash;don't know him from Adam.
      Pleasant, well-informed man&mdash;seemed to have travelled a great deal in
      foreign countries. I can tell you this much, though," he went on, as if a
      sudden recollection had come to him; "I gathered that he'd only just
      arrived in England&mdash;in fact, now I come to think of it, he said as
      much. Made some remark in the train about the pleasantness of the English
      landscape, don't you know?&mdash;I got an idea that he'd recently come
      from some country where trees and hedges and green fields aren't much in
      evidence. But&mdash;if you want to know who he is, officer, why don't you
      search him? He's sure to have papers, cards, and so on about him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have searched him," answered Mitchington. "There isn't a paper, a
      letter, or even a visiting card on him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dellingham looked at the landlady.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless me!" he said. "Remarkable! But he'd a suit-case, or something of
      the sort&mdash;something light&mdash;which he carried up from the railway
      station himself. Perhaps in that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like to see whatever he had," said Mitchington. "We'd better
      examine his room, Mrs. Partingley."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce presently followed the landlady and the inspector upstairs&mdash;Mr.
      Dellingham followed him. All four went into a bedroom which looked out on
      Monday Market. And there, on a side-table, lay a small leather suit-case,
      one which could easily be carried, with its upper half thrown open and
      back against the wall behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlady, Mr. Dellingham and Bryce stood silently by while the
      inspector examined the contents of this the only piece of luggage in the
      room. There was very little to see&mdash;what toilet articles the visitor
      brought were spread out on the dressing-table&mdash;brushes, combs, a case
      of razors, and the like. And Mitchington nodded side-wise at them as he
      began to take the articles out of the suit-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's one thing strikes me at once," he said. "I dare say you gentlemen
      notice it. All these things are new! This suit-case hasn't been in use
      very long&mdash;see, the leather's almost unworn&mdash;and those things on
      the dressing-table are new. And what there is here looks new, too. There's
      not much, you see&mdash;he evidently had no intention of a long stop. An
      extra pair of trousers&mdash;some shirts&mdash;socks&mdash;collars&mdash;neckties&mdash;slippers&mdash;handkerchiefs&mdash;that's
      about all. And the first thing to do is to see if the linen's marked with
      name or initials."
    </p>
    <p>
      He deftly examined the various articles as he took them out, and in the
      end shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No name&mdash;no initials," he said. "But look here&mdash;do you see,
      gentlemen, where these collars were bought? Half a dozen of them, in a
      box. Paris! There you are&mdash;the seller's name, inside the collar, just
      as in England. Aristide Pujol, 82, Rue des Capucines. And&mdash;judging by
      the look of 'em&mdash;I should say these shirts were bought there, too&mdash;and
      the handkerchiefs&mdash;and the neckwear&mdash;they all have a foreign
      look. There may be a clue in that&mdash;we might trace him in France if we
      can't in England. Perhaps he is a Frenchman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll take my oath he isn't!" exclaimed Mr. Dellingham. "However long he'd
      been out of England he hadn't lost a North-Country accent! He was some
      sort of a North-Countryman&mdash;Yorkshire or Lancashire, I'll go bail. No
      Frenchman, officer&mdash;not he!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, there's no papers here, anyway," said Mitchington, who had now
      emptied the suit-case. "Nothing to show who he was. Nothing here, you see,
      in the way of paper but this old book&mdash;what is it&mdash;History of
      Barthorpe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He showed me that in the train," remarked Mr. Dellingham. "I'm interested
      in antiquities and archaeology, and anybody who's long in my society finds
      it out. We got talking of such things, and he pulled out that book, and
      told me with great pride, that he'd picked it up from a book-barrow in the
      street, somewhere in London, for one-and-six. I think," he added musingly,
      "that what attracted him in it was the old calf binding and the steel
      frontispiece&mdash;I'm sure he'd no great knowledge of antiquities."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington laid the book down, and Bryce picked it up, examined the
      title-page, and made a mental note of the fact that Barthorpe was a
      market-town in the Midlands. And it was on the tip of his tongue to say
      that if the dead man had no particular interest in antiquities and
      archaeology, it was somewhat strange that he should have bought a book
      which was mainly antiquarian, and that it might be that he had so bought
      it because of a connection between Barthorpe and himself. But he
      remembered that it was his own policy to keep pertinent facts for his own
      private consideration, so he said nothing. And Mitchington presently
      remarking that there was no more to be done there, and ascertaining from
      Mr. Dellingham that it was his intention to remain in Wrychester for at
      any rate a few days, they went downstairs again, and Bryce and the
      inspector crossed over to the police-station.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news had spread through the heart of the city, and at the
      police-station doors a crowd had gathered. Just inside two or three
      principal citizens were talking to the Superintendent&mdash;amongst them
      was Mr. Stephen Folliot, the stepfather of young Bonham&mdash;a big,
      heavy-faced man who had been a resident in the Close for some years, was
      known to be of great wealth, and had a reputation as a grower of rare
      roses. He was telling the Superintendent something&mdash;and the
      Superintendent beckoned to Mitchington.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Folliot says he saw this gentleman in the Cathedral," he said. "Can't
      have been so very long before the accident happened, Mr. Folliot, from
      what you say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As near as I can reckon, it would be five minutes to ten," answered Mr.
      Folliot. "I put it at that because I'd gone in for the morning service,
      which is at ten. I saw him go up the inside stair to the clerestory
      gallery&mdash;he was looking about him. Five minutes to ten&mdash;and it
      must have happened immediately afterwards."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce heard this and turned away, making a calculation for himself. It had
      been on the stroke of ten when he saw Ransford hurrying out of the west
      porch. There was a stairway from the gallery down to that west porch.
      What, then, was the inference? But for the moment he drew none&mdash;instead,
      he went home to his rooms in Friary Lane, and shutting himself up, drew
      from his pocket the scrap of paper he had taken from the dead man.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. THE SCRAP OF PAPER
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Bryce, in his locked room, drew that bit of paper from his pocket, it
      was with the conviction that in it he held a clue to the secret of the
      morning's adventure. He had only taken a mere glance at it as he withdrew
      it from the dead man's purse, but he had seen enough of what was written
      on it to make him certain that it was a document&mdash;if such a mere
      fragment could be called a document&mdash;of no ordinary importance. And
      now he unfolded and laid it flat on his table and looked at it carefully,
      asking himself what was the real meaning of what he saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not much to see. The scrap of paper itself was evidently a
      quarter of a leaf of old-fashioned, stoutish notepaper, somewhat yellow
      with age, and bearing evidence of having been folded and kept flat in the
      dead man's purse for some time&mdash;the creases were well-defined, the
      edges were worn and slightly stained by long rubbing against the leather.
      And in its centre were a few words, or, rather abbreviations of words, in
      Latin, and some figures:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          In Para.  Wrycestr.  juxt.  tumb.
          Ric. Jenk. ex cap.  xxiii. xv.
</pre>
    <p>
      Bryce at first sight took them to be a copy of some inscription but his
      knowledge of Latin told him, a moment later, that instead of being an
      inscription, it was a direction. And a very plain direction, too!&mdash;he
      read it easily. In Paradise, at Wrychester, next to, or near, the tomb of
      Richard Jenkins, or, possibly, Jenkinson, from, or behind, the head,
      twenty-three, fifteen&mdash;inches, most likely. There was no doubt that
      there was the meaning of the words. What, now, was it that lay behind the
      tomb of Richard Jenkins, or Jenkinson, in Wrychester Paradise?&mdash;in
      all probability twenty-three inches from the head-stone, and fifteen
      inches beneath the surface. That was a question which Bryce immediately
      resolved to find a satisfactory answer to; in the meantime there were
      other questions which he set down in order on his mental tablets. They
      were these:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 1.  Who, really, was the man who had registered at the
     Mitre under the name of John Braden?

 2.  Why did he wish to make a personal call on the
     Duke of Saxonsteade?

 3.  Was he some man who had known Ransford in time
     past&mdash;and whom Ransford had no desire to meet again?

 4.  Did Ransford meet him&mdash;in the Cathedral?

 5.  Was it Ransford who flung him to his death down
     St. Wrytha's Stair?

 6.  Was that the real reason of the agitation in which
     he, Bryce, had found Ransford a few moments after
     the discovery of the body?
</pre>
    <p>
      There was plenty of time before him for the due solution of these
      mysteries, reflected Bryce&mdash;and for solving another problem which
      might possibly have some relationship to them&mdash;that of the exact
      connection between Ransford and his two wards. Bryce, in telling Ransford
      that morning of what was being said amongst the tea-table circles of the
      old cathedral city, had purposely only told him half a tale. He knew, and
      had known for months, that the society of the Close was greatly exercised
      over the position of the Ransford menage. Ransford, a bachelor, a
      well-preserved, active, alert man who was certainly of no more than middle
      age and did not look his years, had come to Wrychester only a few years
      previously, and had never shown any signs of forsaking his single state.
      No one had ever heard him mention his family or relations; then, suddenly,
      without warning, he had brought into his house Mary Bewery, a handsome
      young woman of nineteen, who was said to have only just left school, and
      her brother Richard, then a boy of sixteen, who had certainly been at a
      public school of repute and was entered at the famous Dean's School of
      Wrychester as soon as he came to his new home. Dr. Ransford spoke of these
      two as his wards, without further explanation; the society of the Close
      was beginning to want much more explanation. Who were they&mdash;these two
      young people? Was Dr. Ransford their uncle, their cousin&mdash;what was he
      to them? In any case, in the opinion of the elderly ladies who set the
      tone of society in Wrychester, Miss Bewery was much too young, and far too
      pretty, to be left without a chaperon. But, up to then, no one had dared
      to say as much to Dr. Ransford&mdash;instead, everybody said it freely
      behind his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce had used eyes and ears in relation to the two young people. He had
      been with Ransford a year when they arrived; admitted freely to their
      company, he had soon discovered that whatever relationship existed between
      them and Ransford, they had none with anybody else&mdash;that they knew
      of. No letters came for them from uncles, aunts, cousins, grandfathers,
      grandmothers. They appeared to have no memories or reminiscences of
      relatives, nor of father or mother; there was a curious atmosphere of
      isolation about them. They had plenty of talk about what might be called
      their present&mdash;their recent schooldays, their youthful experiences,
      games, pursuits&mdash;but none of what, under any circumstances, could
      have been a very far-distant past. Bryce's quick and attentive ears
      discovered things&mdash;for instance that for many years past Ransford had
      been in the habit of spending his annual two months' holiday with these
      two. Year after year&mdash;at any rate since the boy's tenth year&mdash;he
      had taken them travelling; Bryce heard scraps of reminiscences of tours in
      France, and in Switzerland, and in Ireland, and in Scotland&mdash;even as
      far afield as the far north of Norway. It was easy to see that both boy
      and girl had a mighty veneration for Ransford; just as easy to see that
      Ransford took infinite pains to make life something more than happy and
      comfortable for both. And Bryce, who was one of those men who firmly
      believe that no man ever does anything for nothing and that self-interest
      is the mainspring of Life, asked himself over and over again the question
      which agitated the ladies of the Close: Who are these two, and what is the
      bond between them and this sort of fairy-godfather-guardian?
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, as he put away the scrap of paper in a safely-locked desk, Bryce
      asked himself another question: Had the events of that morning anything to
      do with the mystery which hung around Dr. Ransford's wards? If it had,
      then all the more reason why he should solve it. For Bryce had made up his
      mind that, by hook or by crook, he would marry Mary Bewery, and he was
      only too eager to lay hands on anything that would help him to achieve
      that ambition. If he could only get Ransford into his power&mdash;if he
      could get Mary Bewery herself into his power&mdash;well and good. Once he
      had got her, he would be good enough to her&mdash;in his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having nothing to do, Bryce went out after a while and strolled round to
      the Wrychester Club&mdash;an exclusive institution, the members of which
      were drawn from the leisured, the professional, the clerical, and the
      military circles of the old city. And there, as he expected, he found
      small groups discussing the morning's tragedy, and he joined one of them,
      in which was Sackville Bonham, his presumptive rival, who was busily
      telling three or four other young men what his stepfather, Mr. Folliot,
      had to say about the event.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My stepfather says&mdash;and I tell you he saw the man," said Sackville,
      who was noted in Wrychester circles as a loquacious and forward youth; "he
      says that whatever happened must have happened as soon as ever the old
      chap got up into that clerestory gallery. Look here!&mdash;it's like this.
      My stepfather had gone in there for the morning service&mdash;strict old
      church-goer he is, you know&mdash;and he saw this stranger going up the
      stairway. He's positive, Mr. Folliot, that it was then five minutes to
      ten. Now, then, I ask you&mdash;isn't he right, my stepfather, when he
      says that it must have happened at once&mdash;immediately?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because that man, Varner, the mason, says he saw the man fall before ten.
      What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the group nodded at Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think Bryce knows what time it happened as well as anybody," he
      said. "You were first on the spot, Bryce, weren't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "After Varner," answered Bryce laconically. "As to the time&mdash;I could
      fix it in this way&mdash;the organist was just beginning a voluntary or
      something of the sort."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That means ten o'clock&mdash;to the minute&mdash;when he was found!"
      exclaimed Sackville triumphantly. "Of course, he'd fallen a minute or two
      before that&mdash;which proves Mr. Folliot to be right. Now what does that
      prove? Why, that the old chap's assailant, whoever he was, dogged him
      along that gallery as soon as he entered, seized him when he got to the
      open doorway, and flung him through! Clear as&mdash;as noonday!"
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the group, a rather older man than the rest, who was leaning back
      in a tilted chair, hands in pockets, watching Sackville Bonham smilingly,
      shook his head and laughed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're taking something for granted, Sackie, my son!" he said. "You're
      adopting the mason's tale as true. But I don't believe the poor man was
      thrown through that doorway at all&mdash;not I!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce turned sharply on this speaker&mdash;young Archdale, a member of a
      well-known firm of architects.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't?" he exclaimed. "But Varner says he saw him thrown!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very likely," answered Archdale. "But it would all happen so quickly that
      Varner might easily be mistaken. I'm speaking of something I know. I know
      every inch of the Cathedral fabric&mdash;ought to, as we're always going
      over it, professionally. Just at that doorway, at the head of St. Wrytha's
      Stair, the flooring of the clerestory gallery is worn so smooth that it's
      like a piece of glass&mdash;and it slopes! Slopes at a very steep angle,
      too, to the doorway itself. A stranger walking along there might easily
      slip, and if the door was open, as it was, he'd be shot out and into space
      before he knew what was happening."
    </p>
    <p>
      This theory produced a moment's silence&mdash;broken at last by Sackville
      Bonham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Varner says he saw&mdash;saw!&mdash;a man's hand, a gentleman's hand,"
      insisted Sackville. "He saw a white shirt cuff, a bit of the sleeve of a
      coat. You're not going to get over that, you know. He's certain of it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Varner may be as certain of it as he likes," answered Archdale, almost
      indifferently, "and still he may be mistaken. The probability is that
      Varner was confused by what he saw. He may have had a white shirt cuff and
      the sleeve of a black coat impressed upon him, as in a flash&mdash;and
      they were probably those of the man who was killed. If, as I suggest, the
      man slipped, and was shot out of that open doorway, he would execute some
      violent and curious movements in the effort to save himself in which his
      arms would play an important part. For one thing, he would certainly throw
      out an arm&mdash;to clutch at anything. That's what Varner most probably
      saw. There's no evidence whatever that the man was flung down."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce turned away from the group of talkers to think over Archdale's
      suggestion. If that suggestion had a basis of fact, it destroyed his own
      theory that Ransford was responsible for the stranger's death. In that
      case, what was the reason of Ransford's unmistakable agitation on leaving
      the west porch, and of his attack&mdash;equally unmistakable&mdash;of
      nerves in the surgery? But what Archdale had said made him inquisitive,
      and after he had treated himself&mdash;in celebration of his freedom&mdash;to
      an unusually good lunch at the Club, he went round to the Cathedral to
      make a personal inspection of the gallery in the clerestory.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a stairway to that gallery in the corner of the south transept,
      and Bryce made straight for it&mdash;only to find a policeman there, who
      pointed to a placard on the turret door. "Closed, doctor&mdash;by order of
      the Dean and Chapter," he announced. "Till further orders. The fact was,
      sir," he went on confidentially, "after the news got out, so many people
      came crowding in here and up to that gallery that the Dean ordered all the
      entrances to be shut up at once&mdash;nobody's been allowed up since
      noon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you haven't heard anything of any strange person being seen
      lurking about up there this morning?" asked Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir. But I've had a bit of a talk with some of the vergers," replied
      the policeman, "and they say it's a most extraordinary thing that none of
      them ever saw this strange gentleman go up there, nor even heard any
      scuffle. They say&mdash;the vergers&mdash;that they were all about at the
      time, getting ready for the morning service, and they neither saw nor
      heard. Odd, sir, ain't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The whole thing's odd," agreed Bryce, and left the Cathedral. He walked
      round to the wicket gate which admitted to that side of Paradise&mdash;to
      find another policeman posted there. "What!&mdash;is this closed, too?" he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And time, sir," said the man. "They'd ha' broken down all the shrubs in
      the place if orders hadn't been given! They were mad to see where the
      gentleman fell&mdash;came in crowds at dinnertime."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce nodded, and was turning away, when Dick Bewery came round a corner
      from the Deanery Walk, evidently keenly excited. With him was a girl of
      about his own age&mdash;a certain characterful young lady whom Bryce knew
      as Betty Campany, daughter of the librarian to the Dean and Chapter and
      therefore custodian of one of the most famous cathedral libraries in the
      country. She, too, was apparently brimming with excitement, and her pretty
      and vivacious face puckered itself into a frown as the policeman smiled
      and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I say, what's that for?" exclaimed Dick Bewery. "Shut up?&mdash;what
      a lot of rot! I say!&mdash;can't you let us go in&mdash;just for a
      minute?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not for a pension, sir!" answered the policeman good-naturedly. "Don't
      you see the notice? The Dean 'ud have me out of the force by tomorrow if I
      disobeyed orders. No admittance, nowhere, nohow! But lor' bless yer!" he
      added, glancing at the two young people. "There's nothing to see&mdash;nothing!&mdash;as
      Dr. Bryce there can tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick, who knew nothing of the recent passages between his guardian and the
      dismissed assistant, glanced at Bryce with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were on the spot first, weren't you?" he asked: "Do you think it
      really was murder?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know what it was," answered Bryce. "And I wasn't first on the
      spot. That was Varner, the mason&mdash;he called me." He turned from the
      lad to glance at the girl, who was peeping curiously over the gate into
      the yews and cypresses. "Do you think your father's at the Library just
      now?" he asked. "Shall I find him there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think he is," answered Betty Campany. "He generally goes down
      about this time." She turned and pulled Dick Bewery's sleeve. "Let's go up
      in the clerestory," she said. "We can see that, anyway."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Also closed, miss," said the policeman, shaking his head. "No admittance
      there, neither. The public firmly warned off&mdash;so to speak. 'I won't
      have the Cathedral turned into a peepshow!' that's precisely what I heard
      the Dean say with my own ears. So&mdash;closed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy and the girl turned away and went off across the Close, and the
      policeman looked after them and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lively young couple, that, sir!" he said. "What they call healthy
      curiosity, I suppose? Plenty o' that knocking around in the city today."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce, who had half-turned in the direction of the Library, at the other
      side of the Close, turned round again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know if your people are doing anything about identifying the dead
      man?" he asked. "Did you hear anything at noon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing but that there'll be inquiries through the newspapers, sir,"
      replied the policeman. "That's the surest way of finding something out.
      And I did hear Inspector Mitchington say that they'd have to ask the Duke
      if he knew anything about the poor man&mdash;I suppose he'd let fall
      something about wanting to go over to Saxonsteade."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce went off in the direction of the Library thinking. The newspapers?&mdash;yes,
      no better channel for spreading the news. If Mr. John Braden had relations
      and friends, they would learn of his sad death through the newspapers, and
      would come forward. And in that case&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it wouldn't surprise me," mused Bryce, "if the name given at the
      Mitre is an assumed name. I wonder if that theory of Archdale's is a
      correct one?&mdash;however, there'll be more of that at the inquest
      tomorrow. And in the meantime&mdash;let me find out something about the
      tomb of Richard Jenkins, or Jenkinson&mdash;whoever he was."
    </p>
    <p>
      The famous Library of the Dean and Chapter of Wrychester was housed in an
      ancient picturesque building in one corner of the Close, wherein, day in
      and day out, amidst priceless volumes and manuscripts, huge folios and
      weighty quartos, old prints, and relics of the mediaeval ages, Ambrose
      Campany, the librarian, was pretty nearly always to be found, ready to
      show his treasures to the visitors and tourists who came from all parts of
      the world to see a collection well known to bibliophiles. And Ambrose
      Campany, a cheery-faced, middle-aged man, with booklover and antiquary
      written all over him, shockheaded, blue-spectacled, was there now, talking
      to an old man whom Bryce knew as a neighbour of his in Friary Lane&mdash;one
      Simpson Barker, a quiet, meditative old fellow, believed to be a retired
      tradesman who spent his time in gentle pottering about the city. Bryce, as
      he entered, caught what Campany was just then saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The most important thing I've heard about it," said Campany, "is&mdash;that
      book they found in the man's suit-case at the Mitre. I'm not a detective&mdash;but
      there's a clue!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. BY MISADVENTURE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Old Simpson Harker, who sat near the librarian's table, his hands folded
      on the crook of his stout walking stick, glanced out of a pair of
      unusually shrewd and bright eyes at Bryce as he crossed the room and
      approached the pair of gossipers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think the doctor was there when that book you're speaking of was
      found," he remarked. "So I understood from Mitchington."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I was there," said Bryce, who was not unwilling to join in the talk.
      He turned to Campany. "What makes you think there's a clue&mdash;in that?"
      he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why this," answered the librarian. "Here's a man in possession of an old
      history of Barthorpe. Barthorpe is a small market-town in the Midlands&mdash;Leicestershire,
      I believe, of no particular importance that I know of, but doubtless with
      a story of its own. Why should any one but a Barthorpe man, past or
      present, be interested in that story so far as to carry an old account of
      it with him? Therefore, I conclude this stranger was a Barthorpe man. And
      it's at Barthorpe that I should make inquiries about him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Simpson Harker made no remark, and Bryce remembered what Mr. Dellingham
      had said when the book was found.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I don't know!" he replied carelessly. "I don't see that that follows.
      I saw the book&mdash;a curious old binding and queer old copper-plates.
      The man may have picked it up for that reason&mdash;I've bought old books
      myself for less."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All the same," retorted Campany, "I should make inquiry at Barthorpe.
      You've got to go on probabilities. The probabilities in this case are that
      the man was interested in the book because it dealt with his own town."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce turned away towards a wall on which hung a number of charts and
      plans of Wrychester Cathedral and its precincts&mdash;it was to inspect
      one of these that he had come to the Library. But suddenly remembering
      that there was a question which he could ask without exciting any
      suspicion or surmise, he faced round again on the librarian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't there a register of burials within the Cathedral?" he inquired.
      "Some book in which they're put down? I was looking in the Memorials of
      Wrychester the other day, and I saw some names I want to trace."
    </p>
    <p>
      Campany lifted his quill pen and pointed to a case of big leather-bound
      volumes in a far corner of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Third shelf from the bottom, doctor," he replied. "You'll see two books
      there&mdash;one's the register of all burials within the Cathedral itself
      up to date: the other's the register of those in Paradise and the
      cloisters. What names are you wanting to trace?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Bryce affected not to hear the last question; he walked over to the
      place which Campany had indicated, and taking down the second book carried
      it to an adjacent table. Campany called across the room to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll find useful indexes at the end," he said. "They're all brought up
      to the present time&mdash;from four hundred years ago, nearly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce turned to the index at the end of his book&mdash;an index written
      out in various styles of handwriting. And within a minute he found the
      name he wanted&mdash;there it was plainly before him&mdash;Richard
      Jenkins, died March 8th, 1715: buried, in Paradise, March 10th. He nearly
      laughed aloud at the ease with which he was tracing out what at first had
      seemed a difficult matter to investigate. But lest his task should seem
      too easy, he continued to turn over the leaves of the big folio, and in
      order to have an excuse if the librarian should ask him any further
      questions, he memorized some of the names which he saw. And after a while
      he took the book back to its shelf, and turned to the wall on which the
      charts and maps were hung. There was one there of Paradise, whereon was
      marked the site and names of all the tombs and graves in that ancient
      enclosure; from it he hoped to ascertain the exact position and
      whereabouts of Richard Jenkins's grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here Bryce met his first check. Down each side of the old chart&mdash;dated
      1850&mdash;there was a tabulated list of the tombs in Paradise. The names
      of families and persons were given in this list&mdash;against each name
      was a number corresponding with the same number, marked on the various
      divisions of the chart. And there was no Richard Jenkins on that list&mdash;he
      went over it carefully twice, thrice. It was not there. Obviously, if the
      tomb of Richard Jenkins, who was buried in Paradise in 1715, was still
      there, amongst the cypresses and yew trees, the name and inscription on it
      had vanished, worn away by time and weather, when that chart had been
      made, a hundred and thirty-five years later. And in that case, what did
      the memorandum mean which Bryce had found in the dead man's purse?
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned away at last from the chart, at a loss&mdash;and Campany glanced
      at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Found what you wanted?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes!" replied Bryce, primed with a ready answer. "I just wanted to
      see where the Spelbanks were buried&mdash;quite a lot of them, I see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Southeast corner of Paradise," said Campany. "Several tombs. I could have
      spared you the trouble of looking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a regular encyclopaedia about the place," laughed Bryce. "I
      suppose you know every spout and gargoyle!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ought to," answered the librarian. "I've been fed on it, man and boy, for
      five-and-forty years."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce made some fitting remark and went out and home to his rooms&mdash;there
      to spend most of the ensuing evening in trying to puzzle out the various
      mysteries of the day. He got no more light on them then, and he was still
      exercising his brains on them when he went to the inquest next morning&mdash;to
      find the Coroner's court packed to the doors with an assemblage of
      townsfolk just as curious as he was. And as he sat there, listening to the
      preliminaries, and to the evidence of the first witnesses, his active and
      scheming mind figured to itself, not without much cynical amusement, how a
      word or two from his lips would go far to solve matters. He thought of
      what he might tell&mdash;if he told all the truth. He thought of what he
      might get out of Ransford if he, Bryce, were Coroner, or solicitor, and
      had Ransford in that witness-box. He would ask him on his oath if he knew
      that dead man&mdash;if he had had dealings with him in times past&mdash;if
      he had met and spoken to him on that eventful morning&mdash;he would ask
      him, point-blank, if it was not his hand that had thrown him to his death.
      But Bryce had no intention of making any revelations just then&mdash;as
      for himself he was going to tell just as much as he pleased and no more.
      And so he sat and heard&mdash;and knew from what he heard that everybody
      there was in a hopeless fog, and that in all that crowd there was but one
      man who had any real suspicion of the truth, and that that man was
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evidence given in the first stages of the inquiry was all known to
      Bryce, and to most people in the court, already. Mr. Dellingham told how
      he had met the dead man in the train, journeying from London to
      Wrychester. Mrs. Partingley told how he had arrived at the Mitre,
      registered in her book as Mr. John Braden, and had next morning asked if
      he could get a conveyance for Saxonsteade in the afternoon, as he wished
      to see the Duke. Mr. Folliot testified to having seen him in the
      Cathedral, going towards one of the stairways leading to the gallery.
      Varner&mdash;most important witness of all up to that point&mdash;told of
      what he had seen. Bryce himself, followed by Ransford, gave medical
      evidence; Mitchington told of his examination of the dead man's clothing
      and effects in his room at the Mitre. And Mitchington added the first
      information which was new to Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In consequence of finding the book about Barthorpe in the suit-case,"
      said Mitchington, "we sent a long telegram yesterday to the police there,
      telling them what had happened, and asking them to make the most careful
      inquiries at once about any townsman of theirs of the name of John Braden,
      and to wire us the result of such inquiries this morning. This is their
      reply, received by us an hour ago. Nothing whatever is known at Barthorpe&mdash;which
      is a very small town&mdash;of any person of that name."
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for that, thought Bryce. He turned with more interest to the next
      witness&mdash;the Duke of Saxonsteade, the great local magnate, a big,
      bluff man who had been present in court since the beginning of the
      proceedings, in which he was manifestly highly interested. It was possible
      that he might be able to tell something of moment&mdash;he might, after
      all, know something of this apparently mysterious stranger, who, for
      anything that Mrs. Partingley or anybody else could say to the contrary,
      might have had an appointment and business with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his Grace knew nothing. He had never heard the name of John Braden in
      his life&mdash;so far as he remembered. He had just seen the body of the
      unfortunate man and had looked carefully at the features. He was not a man
      of whom he had any knowledge whatever&mdash;he could not recollect ever
      having seen him anywhere at any time. He knew literally nothing of him&mdash;could
      not think of any reason at all why this Mr. John Braden should wish to see
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your Grace has, no doubt, had business dealings with a good many people
      at one time or another," suggested the Coroner. "Some of them, perhaps,
      with men whom your Grace only saw for a brief space of time&mdash;a few
      minutes, possibly. You don't remember ever seeing this man in that way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm credited with having an unusually good memory for faces," answered
      the Duke. "And&mdash;if I may say so&mdash;rightly. But I don't remember
      this man at all&mdash;in fact, I'd go as far as to say that I'm positive
      I've never&mdash;knowingly&mdash;set eyes on him in my life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can your Grace suggest any reason at all why he should wish to call on
      you?" asked the Coroner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "None! But then," replied the Duke, "there might be many reasons&mdash;unknown
      to me, but at which I can make a guess. If he was an antiquary, there are
      lots of old things at Saxonsteade which he might wish to see. Or he might
      be a lover of pictures&mdash;our collection is a bit famous, you know.
      Perhaps he was a bookman&mdash;we have some rare editions. I could go on
      multiplying reasons&mdash;but to what purpose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fact is, your Grace doesn't know him and knows nothing about him,"
      observed the Coroner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so&mdash;nothing!" agreed the Duke and stepped down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this stage that the Coroner sent the jurymen away in charge of
      his officer to make a careful personal inspection of the gallery in the
      clerestory. And while they were gone there was some commotion caused in
      the court by the entrance of a police official who conducted to the
      Coroner a middle-aged, well-dressed man whom Bryce at once set down as a
      London commercial magnate of some quality. Between the new arrival and the
      Coroner an interchange of remarks was at once made, shared in presently by
      some of the officials at the table. And when the jury came back the
      stranger was at once ushered into the witness-box, and the Coroner turned
      to the jury and the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are unexpectedly able to get some evidence of identity, gentlemen," he
      observed. "The gentleman who has just stepped into the witness-box is Mr.
      Alexander Chilstone, manager of the London &amp; Colonies Bank, in
      Threadneedle Street. Mr. Chilstone saw particulars of this matter in the
      newspapers this morning, and he at once set off to Wrychester to tell us
      what he knows of the dead man. We are very much obliged to Mr. Chilstone&mdash;and
      when he has been sworn he will perhaps kindly tell us what he can."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of the murmur of sensation which ran round the court, Bryce
      indulged himself with a covert look at Ransford who was sitting opposite
      to him, beyond the table in the centre of the room. He saw at once that
      Ransford, however strenuously he might be fighting to keep his face under
      control, was most certainly agitated by the Coroner's announcement. His
      cheeks had paled, his eyes were a little dilated, his lips parted as he
      stared at the bank-manager&mdash;altogether, it was more than mere
      curiosity that was indicated on his features. And Bryce, satisfied and
      secretly elated, turned to hear what Mr. Alexander Chilstone had to tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was not much&mdash;but it was of considerable importance. Only two
      days before, said Mr. Chilstone&mdash;that was, on the day previous to his
      death&mdash;Mr. John Braden had called at the London &amp; Colonies Bank,
      of which he, Mr. Chilstone, was manager, and introducing himself as having
      just arrived in England from Australia, where, he said, he had been living
      for some years, had asked to be allowed to open an account. He produced
      some references from agents of the London &amp; Colonies Bank, in
      Melbourne, which were highly satisfactory; the account being opened, he
      paid into it a sum of ten thousand pounds in a draft at sight drawn by one
      of those agents. He drew nothing against this, remarking casually that he
      had plenty of money in his pocket for the present: he did not even take
      the cheque-book which was offered him, saying that he would call for it
      later.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He did not give us any address in London, nor in England," continued the
      witness. "He told me that he had only arrived at Charing Cross that very
      morning, having travelled from Paris during the night. He said that he
      should settle down for a time at some residential hotel in London, and in
      the meantime he had one or two calls, or visits, to make in the country:
      when he returned from them, he said, he would call on me again. He gave me
      very little information about himself: it was not necessary, for his
      references from our agents in Australia were quite satisfactory. But he
      did mention that he had been out there for some years, and had speculated
      in landed property&mdash;he also said that he was now going to settle in
      England for good. That," concluded Mr. Chilstone, "is all I can tell of my
      own knowledge. But," he added, drawing a newspaper from his pocket, "here
      is an advertisement which I noticed in this morning's Times as I came
      down. You will observe," he said, as he passed it to the Coroner, "that it
      has certainly been inserted by our unfortunate customer."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Coroner glanced at a marked passage in the personal column of the
      Times, and read it aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The advertisement is as follows," he announced. "'If this meets the eye
      of old friend Marco, he will learn that Sticker wishes to see him again.
      Write J. Braden, c/o London &amp; Colonies Bank, Threadneedle Street,
      London.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce was keeping a quiet eye on Ransford. Was he mistaken in believing
      that he saw him start; that he saw his cheek flush as he heard the
      advertisement read out? He believed he was not mistaken&mdash;but if he
      was right, Ransford the next instant regained full control of himself and
      made no sign. And Bryce turned again to Coroner and witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the witness had no more to say&mdash;except to suggest that the bank's
      Melbourne agents should be cabled to for information, since it was
      unlikely that much more could be got in England. And with that the middle
      stage of the proceedings ended&mdash;and the last one came, watched by
      Bryce with increasing anxiety. For it was soon evident, from certain
      remarks made by the Coroner, that the theory which Archdale had put
      forward at the club in Bryce's hearing the previous day had gained favour
      with the authorities, and that the visit of the jurymen to the scene of
      the disaster had been intended by the Coroner to predispose them in behalf
      of it. And now Archdale himself, as representing the architects who held a
      retaining fee in connection with the Cathedral, was called to give his
      opinion&mdash;and he gave it in almost the same words which Bryce had
      heard him use twenty-four hours previously. After him came the
      master-mason, expressing the same decided conviction&mdash;that the real
      truth was that the pavement of the gallery had at that particular place
      become so smooth, and was inclined towards the open doorway at such a
      sharp angle, that the unfortunate man had lost his footing on it, and
      before he could recover it had been shot out of the arch and over the
      broken head of St. Wrytha's Stair. And though, at a juryman's wish, Varner
      was recalled, and stuck stoutly to his original story of having seen a
      hand which, he protested, was certainly not that of the dead man, it soon
      became plain that the jury shared the Coroner's belief that Varner in his
      fright and excitement had been mistaken, and no one was surprised when the
      foreman, after a very brief consultation with his fellows, announced a
      verdict of death by misadventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So the city's cleared of the stain of murder!" said a man who sat next to
      Bryce. "That's a good job, anyway! Nasty thing, doctor, to think of a
      murder being committed in a cathedral. There'd be a question of sacrilege,
      of course&mdash;and all sorts of complications."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce made no answer. He was watching Ransford, who was talking to the
      Coroner. And he was not mistaken now&mdash;Ransford's face bore all the
      signs of infinite relief. From&mdash;what? Bryce turned, to leave the
      stuffy, rapidly-emptying court. And as he passed the centre table he saw
      old Simpson Harker, who, after sitting in attentive silence for three
      hours had come up to it, picked up the "History of Barthorpe" which had
      been found in Braden's suit-case and was inquisitively peering at its
      title-page.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. THE DOUBLE TRAIL
    </h2>
    <p>
      Pemberton Bryce was not the only person in Wrychester who was watching
      Ransford with keen attention during these events. Mary Bewery, a young
      woman of more than usual powers of observation and penetration, had been
      quick to see that her guardian's distress over the affair in Paradise was
      something out of the common. She knew Ransford for an exceedingly
      tender-hearted man, with a considerable spice of sentiment in his
      composition: he was noted for his more than professional interest in the
      poorer sort of his patients and had gained a deserved reputation in the
      town for his care of them. But it was somewhat surprising, even to Mary,
      that he should be so much upset by the death of a total stranger as to
      lose his appetite, and, for at any rate a couple of days, be so restless
      that his conduct could not fail to be noticed by herself and her brother.
      His remarks on the tragedy were conventional enough&mdash;a most
      distressing affair&mdash;a sad fate for the poor fellow&mdash;most
      unexplainable and mysterious, and so on&mdash;but his concern obviously
      went beyond that. He was ill at ease when she questioned him about the
      facts; almost irritable when Dick Bewery, schoolboy-like, asked him
      concerning professional details; she was sure, from the lines about his
      eyes and a worn look on his face, that he had passed a restless night when
      he came down to breakfast on the morning of the inquest. But when he
      returned from the inquest she noticed a change&mdash;it was evident, to
      her ready wits, that Ransford had experienced a great relief. He spoke of
      relief, indeed, that night at dinner, observing that the verdict which the
      jury had returned had cleared the air of a foul suspicion; it would have
      been no pleasant matter, he said, if Wrychester Cathedral had gained an
      unenviable notoriety as the scene of a murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All the same," remarked Dick, who knew all the talk of the town, "Varner
      persists in sticking to what he's said all along. Varner says&mdash;said
      this afternoon, after the inquest was over&mdash;that he's absolutely
      certain of what he saw, and that he not only saw a hand in a white cuff
      and black coat sleeve, but that he saw the sun gleam for a second on the
      links in the cuff, as if they were gold or diamonds. Pretty stiff evidence
      that, sir, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the state of mind in which Varner was at that moment," replied
      Ransford, "he wouldn't be very well able to decide definitely on what he
      really did see. His vision would retain confused images. Probably he saw
      the dead man's hand&mdash;he was wearing a black coat and white linen. The
      verdict was a most sensible one."
    </p>
    <p>
      No more was said after that, and that evening Ransford was almost himself
      again. But not quite himself. Mary caught him looking very grave, in
      evident abstraction, more than once; more than once she heard him sigh
      heavily. But he said no more of the matter until two days later, when, at
      breakfast, he announced his intention of attending John Braden's funeral,
      which was to take place that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've ordered the brougham for eleven," he said, "and I've arranged with
      Dr. Nicholson to attend to any urgent call that comes in between that and
      noon&mdash;so, if there is any such call, you can telephone to him. A few
      of us are going to attend this poor man's funeral&mdash;it would be too
      bad to allow a stranger to go to his grave unattended, especially after
      such a fate. There'll be somebody representing the Dean and Chapter, and
      three or four principal townsmen, so he'll not be quite neglected. And"&mdash;here
      he hesitated and looked a little nervously at Mary, to whom he was telling
      all this, Dick having departed for school&mdash;"there's a little matter I
      wish you'd attend to&mdash;you'll do it better than I should. The man
      seems to have been friendless; here, at any rate&mdash;no relations have
      come forward, in spite of the publicity&mdash;so&mdash;don't you think it
      would be rather&mdash;considerate, eh?&mdash;to put a wreath, or a cross,
      or something of that sort on his grave&mdash;just to show&mdash;you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very kind of you to think of it," said Mary. "What do you wish me to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you'd go to Gardales', the florists, and order&mdash;something
      fitting, you know," replied Ransford, "and afterwards&mdash;later in the
      day&mdash;take it to St. Wigbert's Churchyard&mdash;he's to be buried
      there&mdash;take it&mdash;if you don't mind&mdash;yourself, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," answered Mary. "I'll see that it's done."
    </p>
    <p>
      She would do anything that seemed good to Ransford&mdash;but all the same
      she wondered at this somewhat unusual show of interest in a total
      stranger. She put it down at last to Ransford's undoubted sentimentality&mdash;the
      man's sad fate had impressed him. And that afternoon the sexton at St.
      Wigbert's pointed out the new grave to Miss Bewery and Mr. Sackville
      Bonham, one carrying a wreath and the other a large bunch of lilies.
      Sackville, chancing to encounter Mary at the florist's, whither he had
      repaired to execute a commission for his mother, had heard her business,
      and had been so struck by the notion&mdash;or by a desire to ingratiate
      himself with Miss Bewery&mdash;that he had immediately bought flowers
      himself&mdash;to be put down to her account&mdash;and insisted on
      accompanying Mary to the churchyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce heard of this tribute to John Braden next day&mdash;from Mrs.
      Folliot, Sackville Bonham's mother, a large lady who dominated certain
      circles of Wrychester society in several senses. Mrs. Folliot was one of
      those women who have been gifted by nature with capacity&mdash;she was
      conspicuous in many ways. Her voice was masculine; she stood nearly six
      feet in her stoutly-soled shoes; her breadth corresponded to her height;
      her eyes were piercing, her nose Roman; there was not a curate in
      Wrychester who was not under her thumb, and if the Dean himself saw her
      coming, he turned hastily into the nearest shop, sweating with fear lest
      she should follow him. Endued with riches and fortified by assurance, Mrs.
      Folliot was the presiding spirit in many movements of charity and
      benevolence; there were people in Wrychester who were unkind enough to say&mdash;behind
      her back&mdash;that she was as meddlesome as she was most undoubtedly
      autocratic, but, as one of her staunchest clerical defenders once pointed
      out, these grumblers were what might be contemptuously dismissed as
      five-shilling subscribers. Mrs. Folliot, in her way, was undoubtedly a
      power&mdash;and for reasons of his own Pemberton Bryce, whenever he met
      her&mdash;which was fairly often&mdash;was invariably suave and polite.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most mysterious thing, this, Dr. Bryce," remarked Mrs. Folliot in her
      deepest tones, encountering Bryce, the day after the funeral, at the
      corner of a back street down which she was about to sail on one of her
      charitable missions, to the terror of any of the women who happened to be
      caught gossiping. "What, now, should make Dr. Ransford cause flowers to be
      laid on the grave of a total stranger? A sentimental feeling?
      Fiddle-de-dee! There must be some reason."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about, Mrs. Folliot,"
      answered Bryce, whose ears had already lengthened. "Has Dr. Ransford been
      laying flowers on a grave?&mdash;I didn't know of it. My engagement with
      Dr. Ransford terminated two days ago&mdash;so I've seen nothing of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My son, Mr. Sackville Bonham," said Mrs. Folliot, "tells me that
      yesterday Miss Bewery came into Gardales' and spent a sovereign&mdash;actually
      a sovereign!&mdash;on a wreath, which, she told Sackville, she was about
      to carry, at her guardian's desire, to this strange man's grave.
      Sackville, who is a warm-hearted boy, was touched&mdash;he, too, bought
      flowers and accompanied Miss Bewery. Most extraordinary! A perfect
      stranger! Dear me&mdash;why, nobody knows who the man was!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Except his bank-manager," remarked Bryce, "who says he's holding ten
      thousand pounds of his."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That," admitted Mrs. Folliot gravely, "is certainly a consideration. But
      then, who knows?&mdash;the money may have been stolen. Now, really, did
      you ever hear of a quite respectable man who hadn't even a visiting-card
      or a letter upon him? And from Australia, too!&mdash;where all the people
      that are wanted run away to! I have actually been tempted to wonder, Dr.
      Bryce, if Dr. Ransford knew this man&mdash;in years gone by? He might
      have, you know, he might have&mdash;certainly! And that, of course, would
      explain the flowers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a great deal in the matter that requires explanation, Mrs.
      Folliot," said Bryce. He was wondering if it would be wise to instil some
      minute drop of poison into the lady's mind, there to increase in potency
      and in due course to spread. "I&mdash;of course, I may have been mistaken&mdash;I
      certainly thought Dr. Ransford seemed unusually agitated by this affair&mdash;it
      appeared to upset him greatly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I have heard&mdash;from others who were at the inquest," responded
      Mrs. Folliot. "In my opinion our Coroner&mdash;a worthy man otherwise&mdash;is
      not sufficiently particular. I said to Mr. Folliot this morning, on
      reading the newspaper, that in my view that inquest should have been
      adjourned for further particulars. Now I know of one particular that was
      never mentioned at the inquest!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh?" said Bryce. "And what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Deramore, who lives, as you know, next to Dr. Ransford," replied
      Mrs. Folliot, "told me this morning that on the morning of the accident,
      happening to look out of one of her upper windows, she saw a man whom,
      from the description given in the newspapers, was, Mrs. Deramore feels
      assured, was the mysterious stranger, crossing the Close towards the
      Cathedral in, Mrs. Deramore is positive, a dead straight line from Dr.
      Ransford's garden&mdash;as if he had been there. Dr. Bryce!&mdash;a direct
      question should have been asked of Dr. Ransford&mdash;had he ever seen
      that man before?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, but you see, Mrs. Folliot, the Coroner didn't know what Mrs. Deramore
      saw, so he couldn't ask such a question, nor could any one else," remarked
      Bryce, who was wondering how long Mrs. Deramore remained at her upper
      window and if she saw him follow Braden. "But there are circumstances, no
      doubt, which ought to be inquired into. And it's certainly very curious
      that Dr. Ransford should send a wreath to the grave of&mdash;a stranger."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went away convinced that Mrs. Folliot's inquisitiveness had been
      aroused, and that her tongue would not be idle: Mrs. Folliot, left to
      herself, had the gift of creating an atmosphere, and if she once got it
      into her head that there was some mysterious connection between Dr.
      Ransford and the dead man, she would never rest until she had spread her
      suspicions. But as for Bryce himself, he wanted more than suspicions&mdash;he
      wanted facts, particulars, data. And once more he began to go over the sum
      of evidence which had accrued.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question of the scrap of paper found in Braden's purse, and of the
      exact whereabouts of Richard Jenkins's grave in Paradise, he left for the
      time being. What was now interesting him chiefly was the advertisement in
      the Times to which the bank-manager from London had drawn attention. He
      had made haste to buy a copy of the Times and to cut out the
      advertisement. There it was&mdash;old friend Marco was wanted by
      (presumably old friend) Sticker, and whoever Sticker might be he could
      certainly be found under care of J. Braden. It had never been in doubt a
      moment, in Bryce's mind, that Sticker was J. Braden himself. Who, now, was
      Marco? Who&mdash;a million to one on it!&mdash;but Ransford, whose
      Christian name was Mark?
    </p>
    <p>
      He reckoned up his chances of getting at the truth of the affair anew that
      night. As things were, it seemed unlikely that any relations of Braden
      would now turn up. The Wrychester Paradise case, as the reporters had
      aptly named it, had figured largely in the newspapers, London and
      provincial; it could scarcely have had more publicity&mdash;yet no one,
      save this bank-manager, had come forward. If there had been any one to
      come forward the bank-manager's evidence would surely have proved an
      incentive to speed&mdash;for there was a sum of ten thousand pounds
      awaiting John Braden's next-of-kin. In Bryce's opinion the chance of
      putting in a claim to ten thousand pounds is not left waiting forty-eight
      hours&mdash;whoever saw such a chance would make instant use of telegraph
      or telephone. But no message from anybody professing relationship with the
      dead man had so far reached the Wrychester police.
    </p>
    <p>
      When everything had been taken into account, Bryce saw no better clue for
      the moment than that suggested by Ambrose Campany&mdash;Barthorpe. Ambrose
      Campany, bookworm though he was, was a shrewd, sharp fellow, said Bryce&mdash;a
      man of ideas. There was certainly much in his suggestion that a man wasn't
      likely to buy an old book about a little insignificant town like Barthorpe
      unless he had some interest in it&mdash;Barthorpe, if Campany's theory
      were true, was probably the place of John Braden's origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, information about Braden, leading to knowledge of his
      association or connection with Ransford, might be found at Barthorpe.
      True, the Barthorpe police had already reported that they could tell
      nothing about any Braden, but that, in Bryce's opinion, was neither here
      nor there&mdash;he had already come to the conclusion that Braden was an
      assumed name. And if he went to Barthorpe, he was not going to trouble the
      police&mdash;he knew better methods than that of finding things out. Was
      he going?&mdash;was it worth his while? A moment's reflection decided that
      matter&mdash;anything was worth his while which would help him to get a
      strong hold on Mark Ransford. And always practical in his doings, he
      walked round to the Free Library, obtained a gazeteer, and looked up
      particulars of Barthorpe. There he learnt that Barthorpe was an ancient
      market-town of two thousand inhabitants in the north of Leicestershire,
      famous for nothing except that it had been the scene of a battle at the
      time of the Wars of the Roses, and that its trade was mainly in
      agriculture and stocking-making&mdash;evidently a slow, sleepy old place.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night Bryce packed a hand-bag with small necessaries for a few days'
      excursion, and next morning he took an early train to London; the end of
      that afternoon found him in a Midland northern-bound express, looking out
      on the undulating, green acres of Leicestershire. And while his train was
      making a three minutes' stop at Leicester itself, the purpose of his
      journey was suddenly recalled to him by hearing the strident voices of the
      porters on the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Barthorpe next stop!&mdash;next stop Barthorpe!"
    </p>
    <p>
      One of two other men who shared a smoking compartment with Bryce turned to
      his companion as the train moved off again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Barthorpe?" he remarked. "That's the place that was mentioned in
      connection with that very queer affair at Wrychester, that's been reported
      in the papers so much these last few days. The mysterious stranger who
      kept ten thousand in a London bank, and of whom nobody seems to know
      anything, had nothing on him but a history of Barthorpe. Odd! And yet,
      though you'd think he'd some connection with the place, or had known it,
      they say nobody at Barthorpe knows anything about anybody of his name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I don't know that there is anything so very odd about it, after
      all," replied the other man. "He may have picked up that old book for one
      of many reasons that could be suggested. No&mdash;I read all that case in
      the papers, and I wasn't so much impressed by the old book feature of it.
      But I'll tell you what&mdash;there was a thing struck me. I know this
      Barthorpe district&mdash;we shall be in it in a few minutes&mdash;I've
      been a good deal over it. This strange man's name was given in the papers
      as John Braden. Now close to Barthorpe&mdash;a mile or two outside it,
      there's a village of that name&mdash;Braden Medworth. That's a curious
      coincidence&mdash;and taken in conjunction with the man's possession of an
      old book about Barthorpe&mdash;why, perhaps there's something in it&mdash;possibly
      more than I thought for at first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;it's an odd case&mdash;a very odd case," said the first
      speaker. "And&mdash;as there's ten thousand pounds in question, more will
      be heard of it. Somebody'll be after that, you may be sure!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce left the train at Barthorpe thanking his good luck&mdash;the man in
      the far corner had unwittingly given him a hint. He would pay a visit to
      Braden Medworth&mdash;the coincidence was too striking to be neglected.
      But first Barthorpe itself&mdash;a quaint old-world little market-town, in
      which some of even the principal houses still wore roofs of thatch, and
      wherein the old custom of ringing the curfew bell was kept up. He found an
      old-fashioned hotel in the marketplace, under the shadow of the parish
      church, and in its oak-panelled dining-room, hung about with portraits of
      masters of foxhounds and queer old prints of sporting and coaching days,
      he dined comfortably and well.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was too late to attempt any investigations that evening, and when Bryce
      had finished his leisurely dinner he strolled into the smoking-room&mdash;an
      even older and quainter apartment than that which he had just left. It was
      one of those rooms only found in very old houses&mdash;a room of nooks and
      corners, with a great open fireplace, and old furniture and old pictures
      and curiosities&mdash;the sort of place to which the old-fashioned
      tradesmen of the small provincial towns still resort of an evening rather
      than patronize the modern political clubs. There were several men of this
      sort in the room when Bryce entered, talking local politics amongst
      themselves, and he found a quiet corner and sat down in it to smoke,
      promising himself some amusement from the conversation around him; it was
      his way to find interest and amusement in anything that offered. But he
      had scarcely settled down in a comfortably cushioned elbow chair when the
      door opened again and into the room walked old Simpson Harker.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. THE BEST MAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Old Harker's shrewd eyes, travelling round the room as if to inspect the
      company in which he found himself, fell almost immediately on Bryce&mdash;but
      not before Bryce had had time to assume an air and look of innocent and
      genuine surprise. Harker affected no surprise at all&mdash;he looked the
      astonishment he felt as the younger man rose and motioned him to the
      comfortable easy-chair which he himself had just previously taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me!" he exclaimed, nodding his thanks. "I'd no idea that I should
      meet you in these far-off parts, Dr. Bryce! This is a long way from
      Wrychester, sir, for Wrychester folk to meet in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd no idea of meeting you, Mr. Harker," responded Bryce. "But it's a
      small world, you know, and there are a good many coincidences in it.
      There's nothing very wonderful in my presence here, though&mdash;I ran
      down to see after a country practice&mdash;I've left Dr. Ransford."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had the lie ready as soon as he set eyes on Harker, and whether the old
      man believed it or not, he showed no sign of either belief or disbelief.
      He took the chair which Bryce drew forward and pulled out an old-fashioned
      cigar-case, offering it to his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you try one, doctor?" he asked. "Genuine stuff that, sir&mdash;I've
      a friend in Cuba who remembers me now and then. No," he went on, as Bryce
      thanked him and took a cigar, "I didn't know you'd finished with the
      doctor. Quietish place this to practise in, I should think&mdash;much
      quieter even than our sleepy old city."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know it?" inquired Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've a friend lives here&mdash;old friend of mine," answered Harker. "I
      come down to see him now and then&mdash;I've been here since yesterday. He
      does a bit of business for me. Stopping long, doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only just to look round," answered Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm off tomorrow morning&mdash;eleven o'clock," said Harker. "It's a
      longish journey to Wrychester&mdash;for old bones like mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you're all right!&mdash;worth half a dozen younger men," responded
      Bryce. "You'll see a lot of your contemporaries out, Mr. Harker. Well&mdash;as
      you've treated me to a very fine cigar, now you'll let me treat you to a
      drop of whisky?&mdash;they generally have something of pretty good quality
      in these old-fashioned establishments, I believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two travellers sat talking until bedtime&mdash;but neither made any
      mention of the affair which had recently set all Wrychester agog with
      excitement. But Bryce was wondering all the time if his companion's story
      of having a friend at Barthorpe was no more than an excuse, and when he
      was alone in his own bedroom and reflecting more seriously he came to the
      conclusion that old Harker was up to some game of his own in connection
      with the Paradise mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The old chap was in the Library when Ambrose Campany said that there was
      a clue in that Barthorpe history," he mused. "I saw him myself examining
      the book after the inquest. No, no, Mr. Harker!&mdash;the facts are too
      plain&mdash;the evidences too obvious. And yet&mdash;what interest has a
      retired old tradesman of Wrychester got in this affair? I'd give a good
      deal to know what Harker really is doing here&mdash;and who his Barthorpe
      friend is."
    </p>
    <p>
      If Bryce had risen earlier next morning, and had taken the trouble to
      track old Harker's movements, he would have learnt something that would
      have made him still more suspicious. But Bryce, seeing no reason for
      hurry, lay in bed till well past nine o'clock, and did not present himself
      in the coffee-room until nearly half-past ten. And at that hour Simpson
      Harker, who had breakfasted before nine, was in close consultation with
      his friend&mdash;that friend being none other than the local
      superintendent of police, who was confidentially closeted with the old man
      in his private house, whither Harker, by previous arrangement, had
      repaired as soon as his breakfast was over. Had Bryce been able to see
      through walls or hear through windows, he would have been surprised to
      find that the Harker of this consultation was not the quiet, easy-going,
      gossipy old gentleman of Wrychester, but an eminently practical and
      business-like man of affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now as regards this young fellow who's staying across there at the
      Peacock," he was saying in conclusion, at the very time that Bryce was
      leisurely munching his second mutton chop in the Peacock coffee-room,
      "he's after something or other&mdash;his talk about coming here to see
      after a practice is all lies!&mdash;and you'll keep an eye on him while
      he's in your neighbourhood. Put your best plainclothes man on to him at
      once&mdash;he'll easily know him from the description I gave you&mdash;and
      let him shadow him wherever he goes. And then let me know of his movement&mdash;he's
      certainly on the track of something, and what he does may be useful to me&mdash;I
      can link it up with my own work. And as regards the other matter&mdash;keep
      me informed if you come on anything further. Now I'll go out by your
      garden and down the back of the town to the station. Let me know, by the
      by, when this young man at the Peacock leaves here, and, if possible&mdash;and
      you can find out&mdash;for where."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce was all unconscious that any one was interested in his movements
      when he strolled out into Barthorpe market-place just after eleven. He had
      asked a casual question of the waiter and found that the old gentleman had
      departed&mdash;he accordingly believed himself free from observation. And
      forthwith he set about his work of inquiry in his own fashion. He was not
      going to draw any attention to himself by asking questions of present-day
      inhabitants, whose curiosity might then be aroused; he knew better methods
      than that. Every town, said Bryce to himself, possesses public records&mdash;parish
      registers, burgess rolls, lists of voters; even small towns have
      directories which are more or less complete&mdash;he could search these
      for any mention or record of anybody or any family of the name of Braden.
      And he spent all that day in that search, inspecting numerous documents
      and registers and books, and when evening came he had a very complete
      acquaintance with the family nomenclature of Barthorpe, and he was
      prepared to bet odds against any one of the name of Braden having lived
      there during the past half-century. In all his searching he had not once
      come across the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man who had spent a very lazy day in keeping an eye on Bryce, as he
      visited the various public places whereat he made his researches, was also
      keeping an eye upon him next morning, when Bryce, breakfasting earlier
      than usual, prepared for a second day's labours. He followed his quarry
      away from the little town: Bryce was walking out to Braden Medworth. In
      Bryce's opinion, it was something of a wild-goose chase to go there, but
      the similarity in the name of the village and of the dead man at
      Wrychester might have its significance, and it was but a two miles' stroll
      from Barthorpe. He found Braden Medworth a very small, quiet, and
      picturesque place, with an old church on the banks of a river which
      promised good sport to anglers. And there he pursued his tactics of the
      day before and went straight to the vicarage and its vicar, with a request
      to be allowed to inspect the parish registers. The vicar, having no
      objection to earning the resultant fees, hastened to comply with Bryce's
      request, and inquired how far back he wanted to search and for what
      particular entry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No particular entry," answered Bryce, "and as to period&mdash;fairly
      recent. The fact is, I am interested in names. I am thinking"&mdash;here
      he used one more of his easily found inventions&mdash;"of writing a book
      on English surnames, and am just now inspecting parish registers in the
      Midlands for that purpose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I can considerably simplify your labours," said the vicar, taking
      down a book from one of his shelves. "Our parish registers have been
      copied and printed, and here is the volume&mdash;everything is in there
      from 1570 to ten years ago, and there is a very full index. Are you
      staying in the neighbourhood&mdash;or the village?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the neighbourhood, yes; in the village, no longer than the time I
      shall spend in getting some lunch at the inn yonder," answered Bryce,
      nodding through an open window at an ancient tavern which stood in the
      valley beneath, close to an old stone bridge. "Perhaps you will kindly
      lend me this book for an hour?&mdash;then, if I see anything very
      noteworthy in the index, I can look at the actual registers when I bring
      it back."
    </p>
    <p>
      The vicar replied that that was precisely what he had been about to
      suggest, and Bryce carried the book away. And while he sat in the inn
      parlour awaiting his lunch, he turned to the carefully-compiled index,
      glancing it through rapidly. On the third page he saw the name Bewery.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the man who had followed Bryce from Barthorpe to Braden Medworth had
      been with him in the quiet inn parlour he would have seen his quarry
      start, and heard him let a stifled exclamation escape his lips. But the
      follower, knowing his man was safe for an hour, was in the bar outside
      eating bread and cheese and drinking ale, and Bryce's surprise was
      witnessed by no one. Yet he had been so much surprised that if all
      Wrychester had been there he could not, despite his self-training in
      watchfulness, have kept back either start or exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bewery! A name so uncommon that here&mdash;here, in this out-of-the-way
      Midland village!&mdash;there must be some connection with the object of
      his search. There the name stood out before him, to the exclusion of all
      others&mdash;Bewery&mdash;with just one entry of figures against it. He
      turned to page 387 with a sense of sure discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there an entry caught his eye at once&mdash;and he knew that he had
      discovered more than he had ever hoped for. He read it again and again,
      gloating over his wonderful luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      June 19th, 1891. John Brake, bachelor, of the parish of St. Pancras,
      London, to Mary Bewery, spinster, of this parish, by the Vicar. Witnesses,
      Charles Claybourne, Selina Womersley, Mark Ransford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty-two years ago! The Mary Bewery whom Bryce knew in Wrychester was
      just about twenty&mdash;this Mary Bewery, spinster, of Braden Medworth,
      was, then, in all probability, her mother. But John Brake who married that
      Mary Bewery&mdash;who was he? Who indeed, laughed Bryce, but John Braden,
      who had just come by his death in Wrychester Paradise? And there was the
      name of Mark Ransford as witness. What was the further probability? That
      Mark Ransford had been John Brake's best man; that he was the Marco of the
      recent Times advertisement; that John Braden, or Brake, was the Sticker of
      the same advertisement. Clear!&mdash;clear as noonday! And&mdash;what did
      it all mean, and imply, and what bearing had it on Braden or Brake's
      death?
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he ate his cold beef, Bryce had copied the entry from the reprinted
      register, and had satisfied himself that Ransford was not a name known to
      that village&mdash;Mark Ransford was the only person of the name mentioned
      in the register. And his lunch done, he set off for the vicarage again,
      intent on getting further information, and before he reached the vicarage
      gates noticed, by accident, a place whereat he was more likely to get it
      than from the vicar&mdash;who was a youngish man. At the end of the few
      houses between the inn and the bridge he saw a little shop with the name
      Charles Claybourne painted roughly above its open window. In that open
      window sat an old, cheery-faced man, mending shoes, who blinked at the
      stranger through his big spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce saw his chance and turned in&mdash;to open the book and point out
      the marriage entry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you the Charles Claybourne mentioned there?" he asked, without
      ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's me, sir!" replied the old shoemaker briskly, after a glance. "Yes&mdash;right
      enough!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How came you to witness that marriage?" inquired Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man nodded at the church across the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've been sexton and parish clerk two-and-thirty years, sir," he said.
      "And I took it on from my father&mdash;and he had the job from his
      father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you remember this marriage?" asked Bryce, perching himself on the
      bench at which the shoemaker was working. "Twenty-two years since, I see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aye, as if it was yesterday!" answered the old man with a smile. "Miss
      Bewery's marriage?&mdash;why, of course!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who was she?" demanded Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Governess at the vicarage," replied Claybourne. "Nice, sweet young lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the man she married?&mdash;Mr. Brake," continued Bryce. "Who was he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A young gentleman that used to come here for the fishing, now and then,"
      answered Claybourne, pointing at the river. "Famous for our trout we are
      here, you know, sir. And Brake had come here for three years before they
      were married&mdash;him and his friend Mr. Ransford."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You remember him, too?" asked Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remember both of 'em very well indeed," said Claybourne, "though I never
      set eyes on either after Miss Mary was wed to Mr. Brake. But I saw plenty
      of 'em both before that. They used to put up at the inn there&mdash;that I
      saw you come out of just now. They came two or three times a year&mdash;and
      they were a bit thick with our parson of that time&mdash;not this one: his
      predecessor&mdash;and they used to go up to the vicarage and smoke their
      pipes and cigars with him&mdash;and of course, Mr. Brake and the governess
      fixed it up. Though, you know, at one time it was considered it was going
      to be her and the other young gentleman, Mr. Ransford&mdash;yes! But, in
      the end, it was Brake&mdash;and Ransford stood best man for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bruce assimilated all this information greedily&mdash;and asked for more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm interested in that entry," he said, tapping the open book. "I know
      some people of the name of Bewery&mdash;they may be relatives."
    </p>
    <p>
      The shoemaker shook his head as if doubtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember hearing it said," he remarked, "that Miss Mary had no
      relations. She'd been with the old vicar some time, and I don't remember
      any relations ever coming to see her, nor her going away to see any."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know what Brake was?" asked Bryce. "As you say he came here for a
      good many times before the marriage, I suppose you'd hear something about
      his profession, or trade, or whatever it was?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was a banker, that one," replied Claybourne. "A banker&mdash;that was
      his trade, sir. T'other gentleman, Mr. Ransford, he was a doctor&mdash;I
      mind that well enough, because once when him and Mr. Brake were fishing
      here, Thomas Joynt's wife fell downstairs and broke her leg, and they
      fetched him to her&mdash;he'd got it set before they'd got the reg'lar
      doctor out from Barthorpe yonder."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce had now got all the information he wanted, and he made the old
      parish clerk a small present and turned to go. But another question
      presented itself to his mind and he reentered the little shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your late vicar?" he said. "The one in whose family Miss Bewery was
      governess&mdash;where is he now? Dead?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't say whether he's dead or alive, sir," replied Claybourne. "He left
      this parish for another&mdash;a living in a different part of England&mdash;some
      years since, and I haven't heard much of him from that time to this&mdash;he
      never came back here once, not even to pay us a friendly visit&mdash;he
      was a queerish sort. But I'll tell you what, sir," he added, evidently
      anxious to give his visitor good value for his half-crown, "our present
      vicar has one of those books with the names of all the clergymen in 'em,
      and he'd tell you where his predecessor is now, if he's alive&mdash;name
      of Reverend Thomas Gilwaters, M.A.&mdash;an Oxford college man he was, and
      very high learned."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce went back to the vicarage, returned the borrowed book, and asked to
      look at the registers for the year 1891. He verified his copy and turned
      to the vicar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I accidentally came across the record of a marriage there in which I'm
      interested," he said as he paid the search fees. "Celebrated by your
      predecessor, Mr. Gilwaters. I should be glad to know where Mr. Gilwaters
      is to be found. Do you happen to possess a clerical directory?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The vicar produced a "Crockford", and Bryce turned over its pages. Mr.
      Gilwaters, who from the account there given appeared to be an elderly man
      who had now retired, lived in London, in Bayswater, and Bryce made a note
      of his address and prepared to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Find any names that interested you?" asked the vicar as his caller left.
      "Anything noteworthy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I found two or three names which interested me immensely," answered Bryce
      from the foot of the vicarage steps. "They were well worth searching for."
    </p>
    <p>
      And without further explanation he marched off to Barthorpe duly followed
      by his shadow, who saw him safely into the Peacock an hour later&mdash;and,
      an hour after that, went to the police superintendent with his report.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gone, sir," he said. "Left by the five-thirty express for London."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. THE HOUSE OF HIS FRIEND
    </h2>
    <p>
      Bryce found himself at eleven o'clock next morning in a small book-lined
      parlour in a little house which stood in a quiet street in the
      neighbourhood of Westbourne Grove. Over the mantelpiece, amongst other
      odds and ends of pictures and photographs, hung a water-colour drawing of
      Braden Medworth&mdash;and to him presently entered an old, silver-haired
      clergyman whom he at once took to be Braden Medworth's former vicar, and
      who glanced inquisitively at his visitor and then at the card which Bryce
      had sent in with a request for an interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Bryce?" he said inquiringly. "Dr. Pemberton Bryce?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce made his best bow and assumed his suavest and most ingratiating
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope I am not intruding on your time, Mr. Gilwaters?" he said. "The
      fact is, I was referred to you, yesterday, by the present vicar of Braden
      Medworth&mdash;both he, and the sexton there, Claybourne, whom you, of
      course, remember, thought you would be able to give me some information on
      a subject which is of great importance&mdash;to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know the present vicar," remarked Mr. Gilwaters, motioning Bryce
      to a chair, and taking another close by. "Clayborne, of course, I remember
      very well indeed&mdash;he must be getting an old man now&mdash;like
      myself! What is it you want to know, now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall have to take you into my confidence," replied Bryce, who had
      carefully laid his plans and prepared his story, "and you, I am sure, Mr.
      Gilwaters, will respect mine. I have for two years been in practice at
      Wrychester, and have there made the acquaintance of a young lady whom I
      earnestly desire to marry. She is the ward of the man to whom I have been
      assistant. And I think you will begin to see why I have come to you when I
      say that this young lady's name is&mdash;Mary Bewery."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old clergyman started, and looked at his visitor with unusual
      interest. He grasped the arm of his elbow chair and leaned forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mary Bewery!" he said in a low whisper. "What&mdash;what is the name of
      the man who is her&mdash;guardian?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Mark Ransford," answered Bryce promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man sat upright again, with a little toss of his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless my soul!" he exclaimed. "Mark Ransford! Then&mdash;it must have
      been as I feared&mdash;and suspected!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce made no remark. He knew at once that he had struck on something, and
      it was his method to let people take their own time. Mr. Gilwaters had
      already fallen into something closely resembling a reverie: Bryce sat
      silently waiting and expectant. And at last the old man leaned forward
      again, almost eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it you want to know?" he asked, repeating his first question. "Is&mdash;is
      there some&mdash;some mystery?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes!" replied Bryce. "A mystery that I want to solve, sir. And I dare say
      that you can help me, if you'll be so good. I am convinced&mdash;in fact,
      I know!&mdash;that this young lady is in ignorance of her parentage, that
      Ransford is keeping some fact, some truth back from her&mdash;and I want
      to find things out. By the merest chance&mdash;accident, in fact&mdash;I
      discovered yesterday at Braden Medworth that some twenty-two years ago you
      married one Mary Bewery, who, I learnt there, was your governess, to a
      John Brake, and that Mark Ransford was John Brake's best man and a witness
      of the marriage. Now, Mr. Gilwaters, the similarity in names is too
      striking to be devoid of significance. So&mdash;it's of the utmost
      importance to me!&mdash;can or will you tell me&mdash;who was the Mary
      Bewery you married to John Brake? Who was John Brake? And what was Mark
      Ransford to either, or to both?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was wondering, all the time during which he reeled off these questions,
      if Mr. Gilwaters was wholly ignorant of the recent affair at Wrychester.
      He might be&mdash;a glance round his book-filled room had suggested to
      Bryce that he was much more likely to be a bookworm than a newspaper
      reader, and it was quite possible that the events of the day had small
      interest for him. And his first words in reply to Bryce's questions
      convinced Bryce that his surmise was correct and that the old man had read
      nothing of the Wrychester Paradise mystery, in which Ransford's name had,
      of course, figured as a witness at the inquest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is nearly twenty years since I heard any of their names," remarked Mr.
      Gilwaters. "Nearly twenty years&mdash;a long time! But, of course, I can
      answer you. Mary Bewery was our governess at Braden Medworth. She came to
      us when she was nineteen&mdash;she was married four years later. She was a
      girl who had no friends or relatives&mdash;she had been educated at a
      school in the North&mdash;I engaged her from that school, where, I
      understood, she had lived since infancy. Now then, as to Brake and
      Ransford. They were two young men from London, who used to come fishing in
      Leicestershire. Ransford was a few years the younger&mdash;he was either a
      medical student in his last year, or he was an assistant somewhere in
      London. Brake&mdash;was a bank manager in London&mdash;of a branch of one
      of the big banks. They were pleasant young fellows, and I used to ask them
      to the vicarage. Eventually, Mary Bewery and John Brake became engaged to
      be married. My wife and I were a good deal surprised&mdash;we had
      believed, somehow, that the favoured man would be Ransford. However, it
      was Brake&mdash;and Brake she married, and, as you say, Ransford was best
      man. Of course, Brake took his wife off to London&mdash;and from the day
      of her wedding, I never saw her again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you ever see Brake again?" asked Bryce. The old clergyman shook his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes!" he said sadly. "I did see Brake again&mdash;under grievous,
      grievous circumstances!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't mind telling me what circumstances?" suggested Bryce. "I will
      keep your confidence, Mr. Gilwaters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is really no secret in it&mdash;if it comes to that," answered the
      old man. "I saw John Brake again just once. In a prison cell!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A prison cell!" exclaimed Bryce. "And he&mdash;a prisoner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He had just been sentenced to ten years' penal servitude," replied Mr.
      Gilwaters. "I had heard the sentence&mdash;I was present. I got leave to
      see him. Ten years' penal servitude!&mdash;a terrible punishment. He must
      have been released long ago&mdash;but I never heard more."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce reflected in silence for a moment&mdash;reckoning and calculating.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When was this&mdash;the trial?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was five years after the marriage&mdash;seventeen years ago," replied
      Mr. Gilwaters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And&mdash;what had he been doing?" inquired Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stealing the bank's money," answered the old man. "I forget what the
      technical offence was&mdash;embezzlement, or something of that sort. There
      was not much evidence came out, for it was impossible to offer any
      defence, and he pleaded guilty. But I gathered from what I heard that
      something of this sort occurred. Brake was a branch manager. He was, as it
      were, pounced upon one morning by an inspector, who found that his cash
      was short by two or three thousand pounds. The bank people seemed to have
      been unusually strict and even severe&mdash;Brake, it was said, had some
      explanation, but it was swept aside and he was given in charge. And the
      sentence was as I said just now&mdash;a very savage one, I thought. But
      there had recently been some bad cases of that sort in the banking world,
      and I suppose the judge felt that he must make an example. Yes&mdash;a
      most trying affair!&mdash;I have a report of the case somewhere, which I
      cut out of a London newspaper at the time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gilwaters rose and turned to an old desk in the corner of his room,
      and after some rummaging of papers in a drawer, produced a
      newspaper-cutting book and traced an insertion in its pages. He handed the
      book to his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is the account," he said. "You can read it for yourself. You will
      notice that in what Brake's counsel said on his behalf there are one or
      two curious and mysterious hints as to what might have been said if it had
      been of any use or advantage to say it. A strange case!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce turned eagerly to the faded scrap of newspaper.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
              BANK MANAGER'S DEFALCATION.

  At the Central Criminal Court yesterday, John Brake,
  thirty-three, formerly manager of the Upper Tooting
  branch of the London &amp; Home Counties Bank, Ltd.,
  pleaded guilty to embezzling certain sums, the
  property of his employers.

  Mr. Walkinshaw, Q.C., addressing the court on behalf
  of the prisoner, said that while it was impossible
  for his client to offer any defence, there were
  circumstances in the case which, if it had been worth
  while to put them in evidence, would have shown that
  the prisoner was a wronged and deceived man.  To use
  a Scriptural phrase, Brake had been wounded in the
  house of his friend.  The man who was really guilty
  in this affair had cleverly escaped all consequences,
  nor would it be of the least use to enter into any
  details respecting him.  Not one penny of the money
  in question had been used by the prisoner for his own
  purposes.  It was doubtless a wrong and improper thing
  that his client had done, and he had pleaded guilty and
  would submit to the consequences.  But if everything in
  connection with the case could have been told, if it
  would have served any useful purpose to tell it, it
  would have been seen that what the prisoner really was
  guilty of was a foolish and serious error of judgment.
  He himself, concluded the learned counsel, would go so
  far as to say that, knowing what he did, knowing what
  had been told him by his client in strict confidence,
  the prisoner, though technically guilty, was morally
  innocent.

  His Lordship, merely remarking that no excuse of any
  sort could be offered in a case of this sort, sentenced
  the prisoner to ten years' penal servitude.
</pre>
    <p>
      Bryce read this over twice before handing back the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very strange and mysterious, Mr. Gilwaters," he remarked. "You say that
      you saw Brake after the case was over. Did you learn anything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing whatever!" answered the old clergyman. "I got permission to see
      him before he was taken away. He did not seem particularly pleased or
      disposed to see me. I begged him to tell me what the real truth was. He
      was, I think, somewhat dazed by the sentence&mdash;but he was also sullen
      and morose. I asked him where his wife and two children&mdash;one, a mere
      infant&mdash;were. For I had already been to his private address and had
      found that Mrs. Brake had sold all the furniture and disappeared&mdash;completely.
      No one&mdash;thereabouts, at any rate&mdash;knew where she was, or would
      tell me anything. On my asking this, he refused to answer. I pressed him&mdash;he
      said finally that he was only speaking the truth when he replied that he
      did not know where his wife was. I said I must find her. He forbade me to
      make any attempt. Then I begged him to tell me if she was with friends. I
      remember very well what he replied.&mdash;'I'm not going to say one word
      more to any man living, Mr. Gilwaters,' he answered determinedly. 'I shall
      be dead to the world&mdash;only because I've been a trusting fool!&mdash;for
      ten years or thereabouts, but, when I come back to it, I'll let the world
      see what revenge means! Go away!' he concluded. 'I won't say one word
      more.' And&mdash;I left him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And&mdash;you made no more inquiries?&mdash;about the wife?" asked Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did what I could," replied Mr. Gilwaters. "I made some inquiry in the
      neighbourhood in which they had lived. All I could discover was that Mrs.
      Brake had disappeared under extraordinarily mysterious circumstances.
      There was no trace whatever of her. And I speedily found that things were
      being said&mdash;the usual cruel suspicions, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such as&mdash;what?" asked Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That the amount of the defalcations was much larger than had been allowed
      to appear," replied Mr. Gilwaters. "That Brake was a very clever rogue who
      had got the money safely planted somewhere abroad, and that his wife had
      gone off somewhere&mdash;Australia, or Canada, or some other far-off
      region&mdash;to await his release. Of course, I didn't believe one word of
      all that. But there was the fact&mdash;she had vanished! And eventually, I
      thought of Ransford, as having been Brake's great friend, so I tried to
      find him. And then I found that he, too, who up to that time had been
      practising in a London suburb&mdash;Streatham&mdash;had also disappeared.
      Just after Brake's arrest, Ransford had suddenly sold his practice and
      gone&mdash;no one knew where, but it was believed&mdash;abroad. I couldn't
      trace him, anyway. And soon after that I had a long illness, and for two
      or three years was an invalid, and&mdash;well, the thing was over and done
      with, and, as I said just now, I have never heard anything of any of them
      for all these years. And now!&mdash;now you tell me that there is a Mary
      Bewery who is a ward of a Dr. Mark Ransford at&mdash;where did you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At Wrychester," answered Bryce. "She is a young woman of twenty, and she
      has a brother, Richard, who is between seventeen and eighteen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Without a doubt those are Brake's children!" exclaimed the old man. "The
      infant I spoke of was a boy. Bless me!&mdash;how extraordinary. How long
      have they been at Wrychester?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ransford has been in practice there some years&mdash;a few years,"
      replied Bryce. "These two young people joined him there definitely two
      years ago. But from what I have learnt, he has acted as their guardian
      ever since they were mere children."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And&mdash;their mother?" asked Mr. Gilwaters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Said to be dead&mdash;long since," answered Bryce. "And their father,
      too. They know nothing. Ransford won't tell them anything. But, as you say&mdash;I've
      no doubt of it myself now&mdash;they must be the children of John Brake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And have taken the name of their mother!" remarked the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had it given to them," said Bryce. "They don't know that it isn't their
      real name. Of course, Ransford has given it to them! But now&mdash;the
      mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, yes, the mother!" said Mr. Gilwaters. "Our old governess! Dear me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going to put a question to you," continued Bryce, leaning nearer and
      speaking in a low, confidential tone. "You must have seen much of the
      world, Mr. Gilwaters&mdash;men of your profession know the world, and
      human nature, too. Call to mind all the mysterious circumstances, the
      veiled hints, of that trial. Do you think&mdash;have you ever thought&mdash;that
      the false friend whom the counsel referred to was&mdash;Ransford? Come,
      now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The old clergyman lifted his hands and let them fall on his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know what to say!" he exclaimed. "To tell you the truth, I have
      often wondered if&mdash;if that was what really did happen. There is the
      fact that Brake's wife disappeared mysteriously&mdash;that Ransford made a
      similar mysterious disappearance about the same time&mdash;that Brake was
      obviously suffering from intense and bitter hatred when I saw him after
      the trial&mdash;hatred of some person on whom he meant to be revenged&mdash;and
      that his counsel hinted that he had been deceived and betrayed by a
      friend. Now, to my knowledge, he and Ransford were the closest of friends&mdash;in
      the old days, before Brake married our governess. And I suppose the
      friendship continued&mdash;certainly Ransford acted as best man at the
      wedding! But how account for that strange double disappearance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce had already accounted for that, in his own secret mind. And now,
      having got all that he wanted out of the old clergyman, he rose to take
      his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will regard this interview as having been of a strictly private
      nature, Mr. Gilwaters?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly!" responded the old man. "But&mdash;you mentioned that you
      wished to marry the daughter? Now that you know about her father's past&mdash;for
      I am sure she must be John Brake's child&mdash;you won't allow that to&mdash;eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not for a moment!" answered Bryce, with a fair show of magnanimity. "I am
      not a man of that complexion, sir. No!&mdash;I only wished to clear up
      certain things, you understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And&mdash;since she is apparently&mdash;from what you say&mdash;in
      ignorance of her real father's past&mdash;what then?" asked Mr. Gilwaters
      anxiously. "Shall you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall do nothing whatever in any haste," replied Bryce. "Rely upon me
      to consider her feelings in everything. As you have been so kind, I will
      let you know, later, how matters go."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was one of Pemberton Bryce's ready inventions. He had not the least
      intention of ever seeing or communicating with the late vicar of Braden
      Medworth again; Mr. Gilwaters had served his purpose for the time being.
      He went away from Bayswater, and, an hour later, from London, highly
      satisfied. In his opinion, Mark Ransford, seventeen years before, had
      taken advantage of his friend's misfortunes to run away with his wife, and
      when Brake, alias Braden, had unexpectedly turned up at Wrychester, he had
      added to his former wrong by the commission of a far greater one.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. DIPLOMACY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Bryce went back to Wrychester firmly convinced that Mark Ransford had
      killed John Braden. He reckoned things up in his own fashion. Some years
      must have elapsed since Braden, or rather Brake's release. He had probably
      heard, on his release, that Ransford and his, Brake's, wife had gone
      abroad&mdash;in that case he would certainly follow them. He might have
      lost all trace of them; he might have lost his original interest in his
      first schemes of revenge; he might have begun a new life for himself in
      Australia, whence he had undoubtedly come to England recently. But he had
      come, at last, and he had evidently tracked Ransford to Wrychester&mdash;why,
      otherwise, had he presented himself at Ransford's door on that eventful
      morning which was to witness his death? Nothing, in Bryce's opinion, could
      be clearer. Brake had turned up. He and Ransford had met&mdash;most likely
      in the precincts of the Cathedral. Ransford, who knew all the quiet
      corners of the old place, had in all probability induced Brake to walk up
      into the gallery with him, had noticed the open doorway, had thrown Brake
      through it. All the facts pointed to that conclusion&mdash;it was a theory
      which, so far as Bryce could see, was perfect. It ought to be enough&mdash;proved&mdash;to
      put Ransford in a criminal dock. Bryce resolved it in his own mind over
      and over again as he sped home to Wrychester&mdash;he pictured the police
      listening greedily to all that he could tell them if he liked. There was
      only one factor in the whole sum of the affair which seemed against him&mdash;the
      advertisement in the Times. If Brake desired to find Ransford in order to
      be revenged on him, why did he insert that advertisement, as if he were
      longing to meet a cherished friend again? But Bryce gaily surmounted that
      obstacle&mdash;full of shifts and subtleties himself, he was ever ready to
      credit others with trading in them, and he put the advertisement down as a
      clever ruse to attract, not Ransford, but some person who could give
      information about Ransford. Whatever its exact meaning might have been,
      its existence made no difference to Bryce's firm opinion that it was Mark
      Ransford who flung John Brake down St. Wrytha's Stair and killed him. He
      was as sure of that as he was certain that Braden was Brake. And he was
      not going to tell the police of his discoveries&mdash;he was not going to
      tell anybody. The one thing that concerned him was&mdash;how best to make
      use of his knowledge with a view to bringing about a marriage between
      himself and Mark Ransford's ward. He had set his mind on that for twelve
      months past, and he was not a man to be baulked of his purpose. By fair
      means, or foul&mdash;he himself ignored the last word and would have
      substituted the term skilful for it&mdash;Pemberton Bryce meant to have
      Mary Bewery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Bewery herself had no thought of Bryce in her head when, the morning
      after that worthy's return to Wrychester, she set out, alone, for the
      Wrychester Golf Club. It was her habit to go there almost every day, and
      Bryce was well acquainted with her movements and knew precisely where to
      waylay her. And empty of Bryce though her mind was, she was not surprised
      when, at a lonely place on Wrychester Common, Bryce turned the corner of a
      spinny and met her face to face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary would have passed on with no more than a silent recognition&mdash;she
      had made up her mind to have no further speech with her guardian's
      dismissed assistant. But she had to pass through a wicket gate at that
      point, and Bryce barred the way, with unmistakable purpose. It was plain
      to the girl that he had laid in wait for her. She was not without a temper
      of her own, and she suddenly let it out on the offender.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you call this manly conduct, Dr. Bryce?" she demanded, turning an
      indignant and flushed face on him. "To waylay me here, when you know that
      I don't want to have anything more to do with you. Let me through, please&mdash;and
      go away!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Bryce kept a hand on the little gate, and when he spoke there was that
      in his voice which made the girl listen in spite of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not here on my own behalf," he said quickly. "I give you my word I
      won't say a thing that need offend you. It's true I waited here for you&mdash;it's
      the only place in which I thought I could meet you, alone. I want to speak
      to you. It's this&mdash;do you know your guardian is in danger?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce had the gift of plausibility&mdash;he could convince people, against
      their instincts, even against their wills, that he was telling the truth.
      And Mary, after a swift glance, believed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What danger?" she asked. "And if he is, and if you know he is&mdash;why
      don't you go direct to him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The most fatal thing in the world to do!" exclaimed Bryce. "You know him&mdash;he
      can be nasty. That would bring matters to a crisis. And that, in his
      interest, is just what mustn't happen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't understand you," said Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce leaned nearer to her&mdash;across the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know what happened last week," he said in a low voice. "The strange
      death of that man&mdash;Braden."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" she asked, with a sudden look of uneasiness. "What of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's being rumoured&mdash;whispered&mdash;in the town that Dr. Ransford
      had something to do with that affair," answered Bryce. "Unpleasant&mdash;unfortunate&mdash;but
      it's a fact."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible!" exclaimed Mary with a heightening colour. "What could he
      have to do with it? What could give rise to such foolish&mdash;wicked&mdash;rumours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know as well as I do how people talk, how they will talk," said
      Bryce. "You can't stop them, in a place like Wrychester, where everybody
      knows everybody. There's a mystery around Braden's death&mdash;it's no use
      denying it. Nobody knows who he was, where he came from, why he came. And
      it's being hinted&mdash;I'm only telling you what I've gathered&mdash;that
      Dr. Ransford knows more than he's ever told. There are, I'm afraid,
      grounds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What grounds?" demanded Mary. While Bryce had been speaking, in his usual
      slow, careful fashion, she had been reflecting&mdash;and remembering
      Ransford's evident agitation at the time of the Paradise affair&mdash;and
      his relief when the inquest was over&mdash;and his sending her with
      flowers to the dead man's grave and she began to experience a sense of
      uneasiness and even of fear. "What grounds can there be?" she added. "Dr.
      Ransford didn't know that man&mdash;had never seen him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's not certain," replied Bryce. "It's said&mdash;remember, I'm only
      repeating things&mdash;it's said that just before the body was discovered,
      Dr. Ransford was seen&mdash;seen, mind you!&mdash;leaving the west porch
      of the Cathedral, looking as if he had just been very much upset. Two
      persons saw this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are they?" asked Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I'm not allowed to tell you," said Bryce, who had no intention of
      informing her that one person was himself and the other imaginary. "But I
      can assure you that I am certain&mdash;absolutely certain!&mdash;that
      their story is true. The fact is&mdash;I can corroborate it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You!" she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I!" replied Bryce. "I will tell you something that I have never told
      anybody&mdash;up to now. I shan't ask you to respect my confidence&mdash;I've
      sufficient trust in you to know that you will, without any asking. Listen!&mdash;on
      that morning, Dr. Ransford went out of the surgery in the direction of the
      Deanery, leaving me alone there. A few minutes later, a tap came at the
      door. I opened it&mdash;and found&mdash;a man standing outside!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not&mdash;that man?" asked Mary fearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That man&mdash;Braden," replied Bryce. "He asked for Dr. Ransford. I said
      he was out&mdash;would the caller leave his name? He said no&mdash;he had
      called because he had once known a Dr. Ransford, years before. He added
      something about calling again, and he went away&mdash;across the Close
      towards the Cathedral. I saw him again&mdash;not very long afterwards&mdash;lying
      in the corner of Paradise&mdash;dead!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Bewery was by this time pale and trembling&mdash;and Bryce continued
      to watch her steadily. She stole a furtive look at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why didn't you tell all this at the inquest?" she asked in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I knew how damning it would be to&mdash;Ransford," replied Bryce
      promptly. "It would have excited suspicion. I was certain that no one but
      myself knew that Braden had been to the surgery door&mdash;therefore, I
      thought that if I kept silence, his calling there would never be known.
      But&mdash;I have since found that I was mistaken. Braden was seen&mdash;going
      away from Dr. Ransford's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By&mdash;whom?" asked Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Deramore&mdash;at the next house," answered Bryce. "She happened to
      be looking out of an upstairs window. She saw him go away and cross the
      Close."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did she tell you that?" demanded Mary, who knew Mrs. Deramore for a
      gossip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Between ourselves," said Bryce, "she did not! She told Mrs. Folliot&mdash;Mrs.
      Folliot told me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So&mdash;it is talked about!" exclaimed Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said so," assented Bryce. "You know what Mrs. Folliot's tongue is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then Dr. Ransford will get to hear of it," said Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will be the last person to get to hear of it," affirmed Bryce. "These
      things are talked of, hole-and-corner fashion, a long time before they
      reach the ears of the person chiefly concerned."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary hesitated a moment before she asked her next question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why have you told me all this?" she demanded at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I didn't want you to be suddenly surprised," answered Bryce.
      "This&mdash;whatever it is&mdash;may come to a sudden head&mdash;of an
      unpleasant sort. These rumours spread&mdash;and the police are still keen
      about finding out things concerning this dead man. If they once get it
      into their heads that Dr. Ransford knew him&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary laid her hand on the gate between them&mdash;and Bryce, who had done
      all he wished to do at that time, instantly opened it, and she passed
      through.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am much obliged to you," she said. "I don't know what it all means&mdash;but
      it is Dr. Ransford's affair&mdash;if there is any affair, which I doubt.
      Will you let me go now, please?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce stood aside and lifted his hat, and Mary, with no more than a nod,
      walked on towards the golf club-house across the Common, while Bryce
      turned off to the town, highly elated with his morning's work. He had sown
      the seeds of uneasiness and suspicion broadcast&mdash;some of them, he
      knew, would mature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Bewery played no golf that morning. In fact, she only went on to the
      club-house to rid herself of Bryce, and presently she returned home,
      thinking. And indeed, she said to herself, she had abundant food for
      thought. Naturally candid and honest, she did not at that moment doubt
      Bryce's good faith; much as she disliked him in most ways she knew that he
      had certain commendable qualities, and she was inclined to believe him
      when he said that he had kept silence in order to ward off consequences
      which might indirectly be unpleasant for her. But of him and his news she
      thought little&mdash;what occupied her mind was the possible connection
      between the stranger who had come so suddenly and disappeared so suddenly&mdash;and
      for ever!&mdash;and Mark Ransford. Was it possible&mdash;really possible&mdash;that
      there had been some meeting between them in or about the Cathedral
      precincts that morning? She knew, after a moment's reflection, that it was
      very possible&mdash;why not? And from that her thoughts followed a natural
      trend&mdash;was the mystery surrounding this man connected in any way with
      the mystery about herself and her brother?&mdash;that mystery of which (as
      it seemed to her) Ransford was so shy of speaking. And again&mdash;and for
      the hundredth time&mdash;she asked herself why he was so reticent, so
      evidently full of dislike of the subject, why he could not tell her and
      Dick whatever there was to tell, once for all?
    </p>
    <p>
      She had to pass the Folliots' house in the far corner of the Close on her
      way home&mdash;a fine old mansion set in well-wooded grounds, enclosed by
      a high wall of old red brick. A door in that wall stood open, and inside
      it, talking to one of his gardeners, was Mr. Folliot&mdash;the vistas
      behind him were gay with flowers and rich with the roses which he passed
      all his days in cultivating. He caught sight of Mary as she passed the
      open doorway and called her back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in and have a look at some new roses I've got," he said. "Beauties!
      I'll give you a handful to carry home."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary rather liked Mr. Folliot. He was a big, half-asleep sort of man, who
      had few words and could talk about little else than his hobby. But he was
      a passionate lover of flowers and plants, and had a positive genius for
      rose-culture, and was at all times highly delighted to take flower-lovers
      round his garden. She turned at once and walked in, and Folliot led her
      away down the scented paths.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's an experiment I've been trying," he said, leading her up to a
      cluster of blooms of a colour and size which she had never seen before.
      "What do you think of the results?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Magnificent!" exclaimed Mary. "I never saw anything so fine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" agreed Folliot, with a quiet chuckle. "Nor anybody else&mdash;because
      there's no such rose in England. I shall have to go to some of these
      learned parsons in the Close to invent me a Latin name for this&mdash;it's
      the result of careful experiments in grafting&mdash;took me three years to
      get at it. And see how it blooms,&mdash;scores on one standard."
    </p>
    <p>
      He pulled out a knife and began to select a handful of the finest blooms,
      which he presently pressed into Mary's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the by," he remarked as she thanked him and they turned away along the
      path, "I wanted to have a word with you&mdash;or with Ransford. Do you
      know&mdash;does he know&mdash;that that confounded silly woman who lives
      near to your house&mdash;Mrs. Deramore&mdash;has been saying some things&mdash;or
      a thing&mdash;which&mdash;to put it plainly&mdash;might make some
      unpleasantness for him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary kept a firm hand on her wits&mdash;and gave him an answer which was
      true enough, so far as she was aware.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure he knows nothing," she said. "What is it, Mr. Folliot?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, you know what happened last week," continued Folliot, glancing
      knowingly at her. "The accident to that stranger. This Mrs. Deramore,
      who's nothing but an old chatterer, has been saying, here and there, that
      it's a very queer thing Dr. Ransford doesn't know anything about him, and
      can't say anything, for she herself, she says, saw the very man going away
      from Dr. Ransford's house not so long before the accident."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not aware that he ever called at Dr. Ransford's," said Mary. "I
      never saw him&mdash;and I was in the garden, about that very time, with
      your stepson, Mr. Folliot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So Sackville told me," remarked Folliot. "He was present&mdash;and so was
      I&mdash;when Mrs. Deramore was tattling about it in our house yesterday.
      He said, then, that he'd never seen the man go to your house. You never
      heard your servants make any remark about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never!" answered Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I told Mrs. Deramore she'd far better hold her tongue," continued
      Folliot. "Tittle-tattle of that sort is apt to lead to unpleasantness. And
      when it came to it, it turned out that all she had seen was this stranger
      strolling across the Close as if he'd just left your house. If&mdash;there's
      always some if! But I'll tell you why I mentioned it to you," he
      continued, nudging Mary's elbow and glancing covertly first at her and
      then at his house on the far side of the garden. "Ladies that are&mdash;getting
      on a bit in years, you know&mdash;like my wife, are apt to let their
      tongues wag, and between you and me, I shouldn't wonder if Mrs. Folliot
      has repeated what Mrs. Deramore said&mdash;eh? And I don't want the doctor
      to think that&mdash;if he hears anything, you know, which he may, and,
      again, he might&mdash;to think that it originated here. So, if he should
      ever mention it to you, you can say it sprang from his next-door
      neighbour. Bah!&mdash;they're a lot of old gossips, these Close ladies!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said Mary. "But&mdash;supposing this man had been to our
      house&mdash;what difference would that make? He might have been for half a
      dozen reasons."
    </p>
    <p>
      Folliot looked at her out of his half-shut eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some people would want to know why Ransford didn't tell that&mdash;at the
      inquest," he answered. "That's all. When there's a bit of mystery, you
      know&mdash;eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded&mdash;as if reassuringly&mdash;and went off to rejoin his
      gardener, and Mary walked home with her roses, more thoughtful than ever.
      Mystery?&mdash;a bit of mystery? There was a vast and heavy cloud of
      mystery, and she knew she could have no peace until it was lifted.

      CHAPTER XI. THE BACK ROOM
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the midst of all her perplexity at that moment, Mary Bewery was certain
      of one fact about which she had no perplexity nor any doubt&mdash;it would
      not be long before the rumours of which Bryce and Mr. Folliot had spoken.
      Although she had only lived in Wrychester a comparatively short time she
      had seen and learned enough of it to know that the place was a hotbed of
      gossip. Once gossip was started there, it spread, widening in circle after
      circle. And though Bryce was probably right when he said that the person
      chiefly concerned was usually the last person to hear what was being
      whispered, she knew well enough that sooner or later this talk about
      Ransford would come to Ransford's own ears. But she had no idea that it
      was to come so soon, nor from her own brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lunch in the Ransford menage was an informal meal. At a quarter past one
      every day, it was on the table&mdash;a cold lunch to which the three
      members of the household helped themselves as they liked, independent of
      the services of servants. Sometimes all three were there at the same
      moment; sometimes Ransford was half an hour late; the one member who was
      always there to the moment was Dick Bewery, who fortified himself
      sedulously after his morning's school labours. On this particular day all
      three met in the dining-room at once, and sat down together. And before
      Dick had eaten many mouthfuls of a cold pie to which he had just liberally
      helped himself he bent confidentially across the table towards his
      guardian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's something I think you ought to be told about, sir," he remarked
      with a side-glance at Mary. "Something I heard this morning at school. You
      know, we've a lot of fellows&mdash;town boys&mdash;who talk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I daresay," responded Ransford dryly. "Following the example of their
      mothers, no doubt. Well&mdash;what is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He, too, glanced at Mary&mdash;and the girl had her work set to look
      unconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's this," replied Dick, lowering his voice in spite of the fact that
      all three were alone. "They're saying in the town that you know something
      which you won't tell about that affair last week. It's being talked of."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford laughed&mdash;a little cynically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you quite sure, my boy, that they aren't saying that I daren't tell?"
      he asked. "Daren't is a much more likely word than won't, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;about that, sir," acknowledged Dick. "Comes to that, anyhow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what are their grounds?" inquired Ransford. "You've heard them, I'll
      be bound!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They say that man&mdash;Braden&mdash;had been here&mdash;here, to the
      house!&mdash;that morning, not long before he was found dead," answered
      Dick. "Of course, I said that was all bosh!&mdash;I said that if he'd been
      here and seen you, I'd have heard of it, dead certain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's not quite so dead certain, Dick, as that I have no knowledge of
      his ever having been here," said Ransford. "But who says he came here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Deramore," replied Dick promptly. "She says she saw him go away from
      the house and across the Close, a little before ten. So Jim Deramore says,
      anyway&mdash;and he says his mother's eyes are as good as another's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doubtless!" assented Ransford. He looked at Mary again, and saw that she
      was keeping hers fixed on her plate. "Well," he continued, "if it will
      give you any satisfaction, Dick, you can tell the gossips that Dr.
      Ransford never saw any man, Braden or anybody else, at his house that
      morning, and that he never exchanged a word with Braden. So much for that!
      But," he added, "you needn't expect them to believe you. I know these
      people&mdash;if they've got an idea into their heads they'll ride it to
      death. Nevertheless, what I say is a fact."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick presently went off&mdash;and once more Ransford looked at Mary. And
      this time, Mary had to meet her guardian's inquiring glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you heard anything of this?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That there was a rumour&mdash;yes," she replied without hesitation. "But&mdash;not
      until just now&mdash;this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who told you of it?" inquired Ransford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary hesitated. Then she remembered that Mr. Folliot, at any rate, had not
      bound her to secrecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Folliot," she replied. "He called me into his garden, to give me
      those roses, and he mentioned that Mrs. Deramore had said these things to
      Mrs. Folliot, and as he seemed to think it highly probable that Mrs.
      Folliot would repeat them, he told me because he didn't want you to think
      that the rumour had originally arisen at his house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good of him, I'm sure," remarked Ransford dryly. "They all like to
      shift the blame from one to another! But," he added, looking searchingly
      at her, "you don't know anything about&mdash;Braden's having come here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw at once that she did, and Mary saw a slight shade of anxiety come
      over his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I do!" she replied. "That morning. But&mdash;it was told to me, only
      today, in strict confidence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In strict confidence!" he repeated. "May I know&mdash;by whom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Bryce," she answered. "I met him this morning. And I think you ought
      to know. Only&mdash;it was in confidence." She paused for a moment,
      looking at him, and her face grew troubled. "I hate to suggest it," she
      continued, "but&mdash;will you come with me to see him, and I'll ask him&mdash;things
      being as they are&mdash;to tell you what he told me. I can't&mdash;without
      his permission."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford shook his head and frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dislike it!" he said. "It's&mdash;it's putting ourselves in his power,
      as it were. But&mdash;I'm not going to be left in the dark. Put on your
      hat, then."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce, ever since his coming to Wrychester, had occupied rooms in an old
      house in Friary Lane, at the back of the Close. He was comfortably lodged.
      Downstairs he had a double sitting-room, extending from the front to the
      back of the house; his front window looked out on one garden, his back
      window on another. He had just finished lunch in the front part of his
      room, and was looking out of his window, wondering what to do with himself
      that afternoon, when he saw Ransford and Mary Bewery approaching. He
      guessed the reason of their visit at once, and went straight to the front
      door to meet them, and without a word motioned them to follow him into his
      own quarters. It was characteristic of him that he took the first word&mdash;before
      either of his visitors could speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know why you've come," he said, as he closed the door and glanced at
      Mary. "You either want my permission that you should tell Dr. Ransford
      what I told you this morning, or, you want me to tell him myself. Am I
      right?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should be glad if you would tell him," replied Mary. "The rumour you
      spoke of has reached him&mdash;he ought to know what you can tell. I have
      respected your confidence, so far."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men looked at each other. And this time it was Ransford who spoke
      first.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems to me," he said, "that there is no great reason for privacy. If
      rumours are flying about in Wrychester, there is an end of privacy. Dick
      tells me they are saying at the school that it is known that Braden called
      on me at my house shortly before he was found dead. I know nothing
      whatever of any such call! But&mdash;I left you in my surgery that
      morning. Do you know if he came there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes!" answered Bryce. "He did come. Soon after you'd gone out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you keep that secret?" demanded Ransford. "You could have told it
      to the police&mdash;or to the Coroner&mdash;or to me. Why didn't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Bryce could answer, all three heard a sharp click of the front
      garden gate, and looking round, saw Mitchington coming up the walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's one of the police, now," said Bryce calmly. "Probably come to
      extract information. I would much rather he didn't see you here&mdash;but
      I'd also like you to hear what I shall say to him. Step inside there," he
      continued, drawing aside the curtains which shut off the back room. "Don't
      stick at trifles!&mdash;you don't know what may be afoot."
    </p>
    <p>
      He almost forced them away, drew the curtains again, and hurrying to the
      front door, returned almost immediately with Mitchington.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hope I'm not disturbing you, doctor," said the inspector, as Bryce
      brought him in and again closed the door. "Not? All right, then&mdash;I
      came round to ask you a question. There's a queer rumour getting out in
      the town, about that affair last week. Seems to have sprung from some of
      those old dowagers in the Close."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course!" said Bryce. He was mixing a whisky-and-soda for his caller,
      and his laugh mingled with the splash of the siphon. "Of course! I've
      heard it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've heard?" remarked Mitchington. "Um! Good health, sir!&mdash;heard,
      of course, that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That Braden called on Dr. Ransford not long before the accident, or
      murder, or whatever it was, happened," said Bryce. "That's it&mdash;eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something of that sort," agreed Mitchington. "It's being said, anyway,
      that Braden was at Ransford's house, and presumably saw him, and that
      Ransford, accordingly, knows something about him which he hasn't told. Now&mdash;what
      do you know? Do you know if Ransford and Braden did meet that morning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at Ransford's house, anyway," answered Bryce promptly. "I can prove
      that. But since this rumour has got out, I'll tell you what I do know, and
      what the truth is. Braden did come to Ransford's&mdash;not to the house,
      but to the surgery. He didn't see Ransford&mdash;Ransford had gone out,
      across the Close. Braden saw&mdash;me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless me!&mdash;I didn't know that," remarked Mitchington. "You never
      mentioned it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll not wonder that I didn't," said Bryce, laughing lightly, "when I
      tell you what the man wanted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did he want, then?" asked Mitchington.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Merely to be told where the Cathedral Library was," answered Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford, watching Mary Bewery, saw her cheeks flush, and knew that Bryce
      was cheerfully telling lies. But Mitchington evidently had no suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That all?" he asked. "Just a question?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just a question&mdash;that question," replied Bryce. "I pointed out the
      Library&mdash;and he walked away. I never saw him again until I was
      fetched to him&mdash;dead. And I thought so little of the matter that&mdash;well,
      it never even occurred to me to mention it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then&mdash;though he did call&mdash;he never saw Ransford?" asked the
      inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you Ransford was already gone out," answered Bryce. "He saw no one
      but myself. Where Mrs. Deramore made her mistake&mdash;I happen to know,
      Mitchington, that she started this rumour&mdash;was in trying to make two
      and two into five. She saw this man crossing the Close, as if from
      Ransford's house and she at once imagined he'd seen and been talking with
      Ransford."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old fool!" said Mitchington. "Of course, that's how these tales get
      about. However, there's more than that in the air."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two listeners behind the curtains glanced at each other. Ransford's
      glance showed that he was already chafing at the unpleasantness of his
      position&mdash;but Mary's only betokened apprehension. And suddenly, as if
      she feared that Ransford would throw the curtains aside and walk into the
      front room, she laid a hand on his arm and motioned him to be patient&mdash;and
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh?" said Bryce. "More in the air? About that business?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so," assented Mitchington. "To start with, that man Varner, the
      mason, has never ceased talking. They say he's always at it&mdash;to the
      effect that the verdict of the jury at the inquest was all wrong, and that
      his evidence was put clean aside. He persists that he did see&mdash;what
      he swore he saw."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He'll persist in that to his dying day," said Bryce carelessly. "If
      that's all there is&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't," interrupted the inspector. "Not by a long chalk! But Varner's
      is a direct affirmation&mdash;the other matter's a sort of ugly hint.
      There's a man named Collishaw, a townsman, who's been employed as a
      mason's labourer about the Cathedral of late. This Collishaw, it seems,
      was at work somewhere up in the galleries, ambulatories, or whatever they
      call those upper regions, on the very morning of the affair. And the other
      night, being somewhat under the influence of drink, and talking the matter
      over with his mates at a tavern, he let out some dark hints that he could
      tell something if he liked. Of course, he was pressed to tell them&mdash;and
      wouldn't. Then&mdash;so my informant tells me&mdash;he was dared to tell,
      and became surlily silent. That, of course, spread, and got to my ears.
      I've seen Collishaw."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" asked Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe the man does know something," answered Mitchington. "That's the
      impression I carried away, anyhow. But&mdash;he won't speak. I charged him
      straight out with knowing something&mdash;but it was no good. I told him
      of what I'd heard. All he would say was that whatever he might have said
      when he'd got a glass of beer or so too much, he wasn't going to say
      anything now neither for me nor for anybody!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so!" remarked Bryce. "But&mdash;he'll be getting a glass too much
      again, some day, and then&mdash;then, perhaps he'll add to what he said
      before. And&mdash;you'll be sure to hear of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not certain of that," answered Mitchington. "I made some inquiry and
      I find that Collishaw is usually a very sober and retiring sort of chap&mdash;he'd
      been lured on to drink when he let out what he did. Besides, whether I'm
      right or wrong, I got the idea into my head that he'd already been&mdash;squared!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Squared!" exclaimed Bryce. "Why, then, if that affair was really murder,
      he'd be liable to being charged as an accessory after the fact!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I warned him of that," replied Mitchington. "Yes, I warned him solemnly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With no effect?" asked Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's a surly sort of man," said Mitchington. "The sort that takes refuge
      in silence. He made no answer beyond a growl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You really think he knows something?" suggested Bryce. "Well&mdash;if
      there is anything, it'll come out&mdash;in time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it'll come out!" assented Mitchington. "I'm by no means satisfied
      with that verdict of the coroner's inquiry. I believe there was foul play&mdash;of
      some sort. I'm still following things up&mdash;quietly. And&mdash;I'll
      tell you something&mdash;between ourselves&mdash;I've made an important
      discovery. It's this. On the evening of Braden's arrival at the Mitre he
      was out, somewhere, for a whole two hours&mdash;by himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought we learned from Mrs. Partingley that he and the other man,
      Dellingham, spent the evening together?" said Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So we did&mdash;but that was not quite so," replied Mitchington. "Braden
      went out of the Mitre just before nine o'clock and he didn't return until
      a few minutes after eleven. Now, then, where did he go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you're trying to find that out?" asked Bryce, after a pause,
      during which the listeners heard the caller rise and make for the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course!" replied Mitchington, with a confident laugh. "And&mdash;I
      shall! Keep it to yourself, doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Bryce had let the inspector out and returned to his sitting-room,
      Ransford and Mary had come from behind the curtains. He looked at them and
      shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You heard&mdash;a good deal, you see," he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here!" said Ransford peremptorily. "You put that man off about the
      call at my surgery. You didn't tell him the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite right," assented Bryce. "I didn't. Why should I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did Braden ask you?" demanded Ransford. "Come, now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Merely if Dr. Ransford was in," answered Bryce, "remarking that he had
      once known a Dr. Ransford. That was&mdash;literally&mdash;all. I replied
      that you were not in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford stood silently thinking for a moment or two. Then he moved
      towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see that any good will come of more talk about this," he said.
      "We three, at any rate, know this&mdash;I never saw Braden when he came to
      my house."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he motioned Mary to follow him, and they went away, and Bryce, having
      watched them out of sight, smiled at himself in his mirror&mdash;with full
      satisfaction.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. MURDER OF THE MASON'S LABOURER
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was towards noon of the very next day that Bryce made a forward step in
      the matter of solving the problem of Richard Jenkins and his tomb in
      Paradise. Ever since his return from Barthorpe he had been making attempts
      to get at the true meaning of this mystery. He had paid so many visits to
      the Cathedral Library that Ambrose Campany had asked him jestingly if he
      was going in for archaeology; Bryce had replied that having nothing to do
      just then he saw no reason why he shouldn't improve his knowledge of the
      antiquities of Wrychester. But he was scrupulously careful not to let the
      librarian know the real object of his prying and peeping into the old
      books and documents. Campany, as Bryce was very well aware, was a walking
      encyclopaedia of information about Wrychester Cathedral: he was, in fact,
      at that time, engaged in completing a history of it. And it was through
      that history that Bryce accidentally got his precious information. For on
      the day following the interview with Mary Bewery and Ransford, Bryce being
      in the library was treated by Campany to an inspection of certain drawings
      which the librarian had made for illustrating his work-drawings, most of
      them, of old brasses, coats of arms, and the like,&mdash;And at the foot
      of one of these, a drawing of a shield on which was sculptured three
      crows, Bryce saw the name Richard Jenkins, armiger. It was all he could
      do to repress a start and to check his tongue. But Campany, knowing
      nothing, quickly gave him the information he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All these drawings," he said, "are of old things in and about the
      Cathedral. Some of them, like that, for instance, that Jenkins shield, are
      of ornamentations on tombs which are so old that the inscriptions have
      completely disappeared&mdash;tombs in the Cloisters, and in Paradise. Some
      of those tombs can only be identified by these sculptures and ornaments."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you know, for instance, that any particular tomb or monument is,
      we'll say, Jenkins's?" asked Bryce, feeling that he was on safe ground.
      "Must be a matter of doubt if there's no inscription left, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" replied Campany. "No doubt at all. In that particular case, there's
      no doubt that a certain tomb out there in the corner of Paradise, near the
      east wall of the south porch, is that of one Richard Jenkins, because it
      bears his coat-of-arms, which, as you see, bore these birds&mdash;intended
      either as crows or ravens. The inscription's clean gone from that tomb&mdash;which
      is why it isn't particularized in that chart of burials in Paradise&mdash;the
      man who prepared that chart didn't know how to trace things as we do
      nowadays. Richard Jenkins was, as you may guess, a Welshman, who settled
      here in Wrychester in the seventeenth century: he left some money to St.
      Hedwige's Church, outside the walls, but he was buried here. There are
      more instances&mdash;look at this, now&mdash;this coat-of-arms&mdash;that's
      the only means there is of identifying another tomb in Paradise&mdash;that
      of Gervase Tyrrwhit. You see his armorial bearings in this drawing? Now
      those&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce let the librarian go on talking and explaining, and heard all he had
      to say as a man hears things in a dream&mdash;what was really active in
      his own mind was joy at this unexpected stroke of luck: he himself might
      have searched for many a year and never found the last resting-place of
      Richard Jenkins. And when, soon after the great clock of the Cathedral had
      struck the hour of noon, he left Campany and quitted the Library, he
      walked over to Paradise and plunged in amongst its yews and cypresses,
      intent on seeing the Jenkins tomb for himself. No one could suspect
      anything from merely seeing him there, and all he wanted was one glance at
      the ancient monument.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Bryce was not to give even one look at Richard Jenkins's tomb that
      day, nor the next, nor for many days&mdash;death met him in another form
      before he had taken many steps in the quiet enclosure where so much of
      Wrychester mortality lay sleeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      From over the topmost branches of the old yew trees a great shaft of
      noontide sunlight fell full on a patch of the grey walls of the
      high-roofed nave. At the foot of it, his back comfortably planted against
      the angle of a projecting buttress, sat a man, evidently fast asleep in
      the warmth of those powerful rays. His head leaned down and forward over
      his chest, his hands were folded across his waist, his whole attitude was
      that of a man who, having eaten and drunken in the open air, has dropped
      off to sleep. That he had so dropped off while in the very act of smoking
      was evident from the presence of a short, well-blackened clay pipe which
      had fallen from his lips and lay in the grass beside him. Near the pipe,
      spread on a coloured handkerchief, were the remains of his dinner&mdash;Bryce's
      quick eye noticed fragments of bread, cheese, onions. And close by stood
      one of those tin bottles in which labouring men carry their drink; its
      cork, tied to the neck by a piece of string, dangled against the side. A
      few yards away, a mass of fallen rubbish and a shovel and wheelbarrow
      showed at what the sleeper had been working when his dinner-hour and time
      for rest had arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something unusual, something curiously noticeable&mdash;yet he could not
      exactly tell what&mdash;made Bryce go closer to the sleeping man. There
      was a strange stillness about him&mdash;a rigidity which seemed to suggest
      something more than sleep. And suddenly, with a stifled exclamation, he
      bent forward and lifted one of the folded hands. It dropped like a leaden
      weight when Bryce released it, and he pushed back the man's face and
      looked searchingly into it. And in that instant he knew that for the
      second time within a fortnight he had found a dead man in Wrychester
      Paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no doubt whatever that the man was dead. His hands and body were
      warm enough&mdash;but there was not a flicker of breath; he was as dead as
      any of the folk who lay six feet beneath the old gravestones around him.
      And Bryce's practised touch and eye knew that he was only just dead&mdash;and
      that he had died in his sleep. Everything there pointed unmistakably to
      what had happened. The man had eaten his frugal dinner, washed it down
      from his tin bottle, lighted his pipe, leaned back in the warm sunlight,
      dropped asleep&mdash;and died as quietly as a child taken from its play to
      its slumbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      After one more careful look, Bryce turned and made through the trees to
      the path which crossed the old graveyard. And there, going leisurely home
      to lunch, was Dick Bewery, who glanced at the young doctor inquisitively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hullo!" he exclaimed with the freedom of youth towards something not much
      older. "You there? Anything on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he looked more clearly, seeing Bryce to be pale and excited. Bryce
      laid a hand on the lad's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here!" he said. "There's something wrong&mdash;again!&mdash;in here.
      Run down to the police-station&mdash;get hold of Mitchington&mdash;quietly,
      you understand!&mdash;bring him here at once. If he's not there, bring
      somebody else&mdash;any of the police. But&mdash;say nothing to anybody
      but them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick gave him another swift look, turned, and ran. And Bryce went back to
      the dead man&mdash;and picked up the tin bottle, and making a cup of his
      left hand poured out a trickle of the contents. Cold tea!&mdash;and, as
      far as he could judge, nothing else. He put the tip of his little finger
      into the weak-looking stuff, and tasted&mdash;it tasted of nothing but a
      super-abundance of sugar.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood there, watching the dead man until the sound of footsteps behind
      him gave warning of the return of Dick Bewery, who, in another minute,
      hurried through the bushes, followed by Mitchington. The boy stared in
      silence at the still figure, but the inspector, after a hasty glance,
      turned a horrified face on Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Lord!" he gasped. "It's Collishaw!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce for the moment failed to comprehend this, and Mitchington shook his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Collishaw!" he repeated. "Collishaw, you know! The man I told you about
      yesterday afternoon. The man that said&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington suddenly checked himself, with a glance at Dick Bewery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember&mdash;now," said Bryce. "The mason's labourer! So&mdash;this
      is the man, eh? Well, Mitchington, he's dead!&mdash;I found him dead, just
      now. I should say he'd been dead five to ten minutes&mdash;not more. You'd
      better get help&mdash;and I'd like another medical man to see him before
      he's removed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington looked again at Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you'd fetch Dr. Ransford, Mr&mdash;Richard?" he asked. "He's
      nearest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Ransford's not at home," said Dick. "He went to Highminster&mdash;some
      County Council business or other&mdash;at ten this morning, and he won't
      be back until four&mdash;I happen to know that. Shall I run for Dr.
      Coates?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you wouldn't mind," said Mitchington, "and as it's close by, drop in
      at the station again and tell the sergeant to come here with a couple of
      men. I say!" he went on, when the boy had hurried off, "this is a queer
      business, Dr. Bryce! What do you think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think this," answered Bryce. "That man!&mdash;look at him!&mdash;a
      strong, healthy-looking fellow, in the very prime of life&mdash;that man
      has met his death by foul means. You take particular care of those dinner
      things of his&mdash;the remains of his dinner, every scrap&mdash;and of
      that tin bottle. That, especially. Take all these things yourself,
      Mitchington, and lock them up&mdash;they'll be wanted for examination."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington glanced at the simple matters which Bryce indicated. And
      suddenly he turned a half-frightened glance on his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't mean to say that&mdash;that you suspect he's been poisoned?" he
      asked. "Good Lord, if that is so&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think you'll find that there's much doubt about it," answered
      Bryce. "But that's a point that will soon be settled. You'd better tell
      the Coroner at once, Mitchington, and he'll issue a formal order to Dr.
      Coates to make a post-mortem. And," he added significantly, "I shall be
      surprised if it isn't as I say&mdash;poison!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If that's so," observed Mitchington, with a grim shake of his head, "if
      that really is so, then I know what I shall think! This!" he went on,
      pointing to the dead man, "this is&mdash;a sort of sequel to the other
      affair. There's been something in what the poor chap said&mdash;he did
      know something against somebody, and that somebody's got to hear of it&mdash;and
      silenced him. But, Lord, doctor, how can it have been done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can see how it can have been done, easy enough," said Bryce. "This man
      has evidently been at work here, by himself, all the morning. He of course
      brought his dinner with him. He no doubt put his basket and his bottle
      down somewhere, while he did his work. What easier than for some one to
      approach through these trees and shrubs while the man's back was turned,
      or he was busy round one of these corners, and put some deadly poison into
      that bottle? Nothing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," remarked Mitchington, "if that's so, it proves something else&mdash;to
      my mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" asked Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, that whoever it was who did it was somebody who had a knowledge of
      poison!" answered Mitchington. "And I should say there aren't many people
      in Wrychester who have such knowledge outside yourselves and the chemists.
      It's a black business, this!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce nodded silently. He waited until Dr. Coates, an elderly man who was
      the leading practitioner in the town, arrived, and to him he gave a
      careful account of his discovery. And after the police had taken the body
      away, and he had accompanied Mitchington to the police-station and seen
      the tin bottle and the remains of Collishaw's dinner safely locked up, he
      went home to lunch, and to wonder at this strange development. The
      inspector was doubtless right in saying that Collishaw had been done to
      death by somebody who wanted to silence him&mdash;but who could that
      somebody be? Bryce's thoughts immediately turned to the fact that Ransford
      had overheard all that Mitchington had said, in that very room in which
      he, Bryce, was then lunching&mdash;Ransford! Was it possible that Ransford
      had realized a danger in Collishaw's knowledge, and had&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was interrupted at this stage by Mitchington, who came hurriedly in
      with a scared face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, I say!" he whispered as soon as Bryce's landlady had shut the door
      on them. "Here's a fine business! I've heard something&mdash;something I
      can hardly credit&mdash;but it's true. I've been to tell Collishaw's
      family what's happened. And&mdash;I'm fairly dazed by it&mdash;yet it's
      there&mdash;it is so!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's so?" demanded Bryce. "What is it that's true?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington bent closer over the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Ransford was fetched to Collishaw's cottage at six o'clock this
      morning!" he said. "It seems that Collishaw's wife has been in a poor way
      about her health of late, and Dr. Ransford has attended her, off and on.
      She had some sort of a seizure this morning&mdash;early&mdash;and Ransford
      was sent for. He was there some little time&mdash;and I've heard some
      queer things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What sort of queer things?" demanded Bryce. "Don't be afraid of speaking
      out, man!&mdash;there's no one to hear but myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, things that look suspicious, on the face of it," continued
      Mitchington, who was obviously much upset. "As you'll acknowledge when you
      hear them. I got my information from the next-door neighbour, Mrs. Batts.
      Mrs. Batts says that when Ransford&mdash;who'd been fetched by Mrs.
      Batts's eldest lad&mdash;came to Collishaw's house, Collishaw was putting
      up his dinner to take to his work&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What on earth made Mrs. Batts tell you that?" interrupted Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well, to tell you the truth, I put a few questions to her as to what
      went on while Ransford was in the house," answered Mitchington. "When I'd
      once found that he had been there, you know, I naturally wanted to know
      all I could."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" asked Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Collishaw, I say, was putting up his dinner to take to his work,"
      continued Mitchington. "Mrs. Batts was doing a thing or two about the
      house. Ransford went upstairs to see Mrs. Collishaw. After a while he came
      down and said he would have to remain a little. Collishaw went up to speak
      to his wife before going out. And then Ransford asked Mrs. Batts for
      something&mdash;I forget what&mdash;some small matter which the
      Collishaw's hadn't got and she had, and she went next door to fetch it.
      Therefore&mdash;do you see?&mdash;Ransford was left alone with&mdash;Collishaw's
      tin bottle!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce, who had been listening attentively, looked steadily at the
      inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're suspecting Ransford already!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's it look like?" he answered, almost appealingly. "I put it to you,
      now!&mdash;what does it look like? Here's this man been poisoned without a
      doubt&mdash;I'm certain of it. And&mdash;there were those rumours&mdash;it's
      idle to deny that they centred in Ransford. And&mdash;this morning
      Ransford had the chance!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's arguing that Ransford purposely carried a dose of poison to put
      into Collishaw's tin bottle!" said Bryce half-sneeringly. "Not very
      probable, you know, Mitchington."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington spread out his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, there it is!" he said. "As I say, there's no denying the suspicious
      look of it. If I were only certain that those rumours about what Collishaw
      hinted he could say had got to Ransford's ears!&mdash;why, then&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's being done about that post-mortem?" asked Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Coates and Dr. Everest are going to do it this afternoon," replied
      Mitchington. "The Coroner went to them at once, as soon as I told him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They'll probably have to call in an expert from London," said Bryce.
      "However, you can't do anything definite, you know, until the result's
      known. Don't say anything of this to anybody. I'll drop in at your place
      later and hear if Coates can say anything really certain."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington went away, and Bryce spent the rest of the afternoon
      wondering, speculating and scheming. If Ransford had really got rid of
      this man who knew something&mdash;why, then, it was certainly Ransford who
      killed Braden.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went round to the police-station at five o'clock. Mitchington drew him
      aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Coates says there's no doubt about it!" he whispered. "Poisoned!
      Hydrocyanic acid!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. BRYCE IS ASKED A QUESTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mitchington stepped aside into a private room, motioning Bryce to follow
      him. He carefully closed the door, and looking significantly at his
      companion, repeated his last words, with a shake of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poisoned!&mdash;without the very least doubt," he whispered. "Hydrocyanic
      acid&mdash;which, I understand, is the same thing as what's commonly
      called prussic acid. They say then hadn't the least difficulty in finding
      that out! so there you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what Coates has told you, of course?" asked Bryce. "After the
      autopsy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Both of 'em told me&mdash;Coates, and Everest, who helped him," replied
      Mitchington. "They said it was obvious from the very start. And&mdash;I
      say!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" said Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It wasn't in that tin bottle, anyway," remarked Mitchington, who was
      evidently greatly weighted with mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!&mdash;of course it wasn't!" affirmed Bryce. "Good Heavens, man&mdash;I
      know that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you know?" asked Mitchington.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I poured a few drops from that bottle into my hand when I first
      found Collishaw and tasted the stuff," answered Bryce readily. "Cold tea!
      with too much sugar in it. There was no H.C.N. in that besides, wherever
      it is, there's always a smell stronger or fainter&mdash;of bitter almonds.
      There was none about that bottle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet you were very anxious that we should take care of the bottle?"
      observed Mitchington.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course!&mdash;because I suspected the use of some much rarer poison
      than that," retorted Bryce. "Pooh!&mdash;it's a clumsy way of poisoning
      anybody!&mdash;quick though it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, there's where it is!" said Mitchington. "That'll be the medical
      evidence at the inquest, anyway. That's how it was done. And the question
      now is&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who did it?" interrupted Bryce. "Precisely! Well&mdash;I'll say this much
      at once, Mitchington. Whoever did it was either a big bungler&mdash;or
      damned clever! That's what I say!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't understand you," said Mitchington.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Plain enough&mdash;my meaning," replied Bryce, smiling. "To finish
      anybody with that stuff is easy enough&mdash;but no poison is more easily
      detected. It's an amateurish way of poisoning anybody&mdash;unless you can
      do it in such a fashion that no suspicion can attach you to. And in this
      case it's here&mdash;whoever administered that poison to Collishaw must
      have been certain&mdash;absolutely certain, mind you!&mdash;that it was
      impossible for any one to find out that he'd done so. Therefore, I say
      what I said&mdash;the man must be damned clever. Otherwise, he'd be found
      out pretty quick. And all that puzzles me is&mdash;how was it
      administered?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much would kill anybody&mdash;pretty quick?" asked Mitchington.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much? One drop would cause instantaneous death!" answered Bryce.
      "Cause paralysis of the heart, there and then, instantly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington remained silent awhile, looking meditatively at Bryce. Then he
      turned to a locked drawer, produced a key, and took something out of the
      drawer&mdash;a small object, wrapped in paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm telling you a good deal, doctor," he said. "But as you know so much
      already, I'll tell you a bit more. Look at this!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened his hand and showed Bryce a small cardboard pill-box, across the
      face of which a few words were written&mdash;One after meals&mdash;Mr.
      Collishaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whose handwriting's that?" demanded Mitchington.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce looked closer, and started.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ransford's!" he muttered. "Ransford&mdash;of course!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That box was in Collishaw's waistcoat pocket," said Mitchington. "There
      are pills inside it, now. See!" He took off the lid of the box and
      revealed four sugar-coated pills. "It wouldn't hold more than six, this,"
      he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce extracted a pill and put his nose to it, after scratching a little
      of the sugar coating away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mere digestive pills," he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could&mdash;it!&mdash;have been given in one of these?" asked
      Mitchington.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possible," replied Bryce. He stood thinking for a moment. "Have you shown
      those things to Coates and Everest?" he asked at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not yet," replied Mitchington. "I wanted to find out, first, if Ransford
      gave this box to Collishaw, and when. I'm going to Collishaw's house
      presently&mdash;I've certain inquiries to make. His widow'll know about
      these pills."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're suspecting Ransford," said Bryce. "That's certain!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington carefully put away the pill-box and relocked the drawer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got some decidedly uncomfortable ideas&mdash;which I'd much rather
      not have&mdash;about Dr. Ransford," he said. "When one thing seems to fit
      into another, what is one to think. If I were certain that that rumour
      which spread, about Collishaw's knowledge of something&mdash;you know, had
      got to Ransford's ears&mdash;why, I should say it looked very much as if
      Ransford wanted to stop Collishaw's tongue for good before it could say
      more&mdash;and next time, perhaps, something definite. If men once begin
      to hint that they know something, they don't stop at hinting. Collishaw
      might have spoken plainly before long&mdash;to us!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce asked a question about the holding of the inquest and went away. And
      after thinking things over, he turned in the direction of the Cathedral,
      and made his way through the Cloisters to the Close. He was going to make
      another move in his own game, while there was a good chance. Everything at
      this juncture was throwing excellent cards into his hand&mdash;he would be
      foolish, he thought, not to play them to advantage. And so he made
      straight for Ransford's house, and before he reached it, met Ransford and
      Mary Bewery, who were crossing the Close from another point, on their way
      from the railway station, whither Mary had gone especially to meet her
      guardian. They were in such deep conversation that Bryce was close upon
      them before they observed his presence. When Ransford saw his late
      assistant, he scowled unconsciously&mdash;Bryce, and the interview of the
      previous afternoon, had been much in his thoughts all day, and he had an
      uneasy feeling that Bryce was playing some game. Bryce was quick to see
      that scowl&mdash;and to observe the sudden start which Mary could not
      repress&mdash;and he was just as quick to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was going to your house, Dr. Ransford," he remarked quietly. "I don't
      want to force my presence on you, now or at any time&mdash;but I think
      you'd better give me a few minutes."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were at Ransford's garden gate by that time, and Ransford flung it
      open and motioned Bryce to follow. He led the way into the dining-room,
      closed the door on the three, and looked at Bryce. Bryce took the glance
      as a question, and put another, in words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've heard of what's happened during the day?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "About Collishaw&mdash;yes," answered Ransford. "Miss Bewery has just told
      me&mdash;what her brother told her. What of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have just come from the police-station," said Bryce. "Coates and
      Everest have carried out an autopsy this afternoon. Mitchington told me
      the result."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" demanded Ransford, with no attempt to conceal his impatience. "And
      what then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Collishaw was poisoned," replied Bryce, watching Ransford with a
      closeness which Mary did not fail to observe. "H.C.N. No doubt at all
      about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;and what then?" asked Ransford, still more impatiently. "To be
      explicit&mdash;what's all this to do with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I came here to do you a service," answered Bryce. "Whether you like to
      take it or not is your look-out. You may as well know it you're in danger.
      Collishaw is the man who hinted&mdash;as you heard yesterday in my rooms&mdash;that
      he could say something definite about the Braden affair&mdash;if he
      liked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" said Ransford.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's known&mdash;to the police&mdash;that you were at Collishaw's house
      early this morning," said Bryce. "Mitchington knows it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does Mitchington know that I overheard what he said to you, yesterday
      afternoon?" he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, he doesn't," answered Bryce. "He couldn't possibly know unless I told
      him. I haven't told him&mdash;I'm not going to tell him. But&mdash;he's
      suspicious already."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of me, of course," suggested Ransford, with another laugh. He took a turn
      across the room and suddenly faced round on Bryce, who had remained
      standing near the door. "Do you really mean to tell me that Mitchington is
      such a fool as to believe that I would poison a poor working man&mdash;and
      in that clumsy fashion?" he burst out. "Of course you don't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never said I did," answered Bryce. "I'm only telling you what
      Mitchington thinks his grounds for suspecting. He confided in me because&mdash;well,
      it was I who found Collishaw. Mitchington is in possession of a box of
      digestive pills which you evidently gave Collishaw."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bah!" exclaimed Ransford. "The man's a fool! Let him come and talk to
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He won't do that&mdash;yet," said Bryce. "But&mdash;I'm afraid he'll
      bring all this out at the inquest. The fact is&mdash;he's suspicious&mdash;what
      with one thing or another&mdash;about the former affair. He thinks you
      concealed the truth&mdash;whatever it may be&mdash;as regards any
      knowledge of Braden which you may or mayn't have."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll tell you what it is!" said Ransford suddenly. "It just comes to this&mdash;I'm
      suspected of having had a hand&mdash;the hand, if you like!&mdash;in
      Braden's death, and now of getting rid of Collishaw because Collishaw
      could prove that I had that hand. That's about it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A clear way of putting it, certainly," assented Bryce. "But&mdash;there's
      a very clear way, too, of dissipating any such ideas."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What way?" demanded Ransford.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you do know anything about the Braden affair&mdash;why not reveal it,
      and be done with the whole thing," suggested Bryce. "That would finish
      matters."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford took a long, silent look at his questioner. And Bryce looked
      steadily back&mdash;and Mary Bewery anxiously watched both men.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's my business," said Ransford at last. "I'm neither to be coerced,
      bullied, or cajoled. I'm obliged to you for giving me a hint of my&mdash;danger,
      I suppose! And&mdash;I don't propose to say any more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Neither do I," said Bryce. "I only came to tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      And therewith, having successfully done all that he wanted to do, he
      walked out of the room and the house, and Ransford, standing in the
      window, his hands thrust in his pockets, watched him go away across the
      Close.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Guardian!" said Mary softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford turned sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wouldn't it be best," she continued, speaking nervously, "if&mdash;if you
      do know anything about that unfortunate man&mdash;if you told it? Why have
      this suspicion fastening itself on you? You!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford made an effort to calm himself. He was furiously angry&mdash;angry
      with Bryce, angry with Mitchington, angry with the cloud of foolishness
      and stupidity that seemed to be gathering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should I&mdash;supposing that I do know something, which I don't
      admit&mdash;why should I allow myself to be coerced and frightened by
      these fools?" he asked. "No man can prevent suspicion falling on him&mdash;it's
      my bad luck in this instance. Why should I rush to the police-station and
      say, 'Here&mdash;I'll blurt out all I know&mdash;everything!' Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wouldn't that be better than knowing that people are saying things?" she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to that," replied Ransford, "you can't prevent people saying things&mdash;especially
      in a town like this. If it hadn't been for the unfortunate fact that
      Braden came to the surgery door, nothing would have been said. But what of
      that?&mdash;I have known hundreds of men in my time&mdash;aye, and
      forgotten them! No!&mdash;I am not going to fall a victim to this device&mdash;it
      all springs out of curiosity. As to this last affair&mdash;it's all
      nonsense!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;if the man was really poisoned?" suggested Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let the police find the poisoner!" said Ransford, with a grim smile.
      "That's their job."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary said nothing for a moment, and Ransford moved restlessly about the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't trust that fellow Bryce," he said suddenly. "He's up to
      something. I don't forget what he said when I bundled him out that
      morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That he would be a bad enemy," answered Ransford. "He's posing now as a
      friend&mdash;but a man's never to be so much suspected as when he comes
      doing what you may call unnecessary acts of friendship. I'd rather that
      anybody was mixed up in my affairs&mdash;your affairs&mdash;than Pemberton
      Bryce!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So would I!" she said. "But&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused there a moment and then looked appealingly at Ransford.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do wish you'd tell me&mdash;what you promised to tell me," she said.
      "You know what I mean&mdash;about me and Dick. Somehow&mdash;I don't quite
      know how or why&mdash;I've an uneasy feeling that Bryce knows something,
      and that he's mixing it all up with&mdash;this! Why not tell me&mdash;please!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford, who was still marching about the room, came to a halt, and
      leaning his hands on the table between them, looked earnestly at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't ask that&mdash;now!" he said. "I can't&mdash;yet. The fact is, I'm
      waiting for something&mdash;some particulars. As soon as I get them, I'll
      speak to you&mdash;and to Dick. In the meantime&mdash;don't ask me again&mdash;and
      don't be afraid. And as to this affair, leave it to me&mdash;and if you
      meet Bryce again, refuse to discuss any thing with him. Look here!&mdash;there's
      only one reason why he professes friendliness and a desire to save me
      annoyance. He thinks he can ingratiate himself with&mdash;you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mistaken!" murmured Mary, shaking her head. "I don't trust him. And&mdash;less
      than ever because of yesterday. Would an honest man have done what he did?
      Let that police inspector talk freely, as he did, with people concealed
      behind a curtain? And&mdash;he laughed about it! I hated myself for being
      there&mdash;yet could we help it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not going to hate myself on Pemberton Bryce's account," said
      Ransford. "Let him play his game&mdash;that he has one, I'm certain."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce had gone away to continue his game&mdash;or another line of it. The
      Collishaw matter had not made him forget the Richard Jenkins tomb, and
      now, after leaving Ransford's house, he crossed the Close to Paradise with
      the object of doing a little more investigation. But at the archway of the
      ancient enclosure he met old Simpson Harker, pottering about in his usual
      apparently aimless fashion. Harker smiled at sight of Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I was wanting to have a word with you, doctor!" he said. "Something
      important. Have you got a minute or two to spare, sir? Come round to my
      little place, then&mdash;we shall be quiet there."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce had any amount of time to spare for an interesting person like
      Harker, and he followed the old man to his house&mdash;a tiny place set in
      a nest of similar old-world buildings behind the Close. Harker led him
      into a little parlour, comfortable and snug, wherein were several shelves
      of books of a curiously legal and professional-looking aspect, some old
      pictures, and a cabinet of odds and ends, stowed away in of dark corner.
      The old man motioned him to an easy chair, and going over to a cupboard,
      produced a decanter of whisky and a box of cigars.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can have a peaceful and comfortable talk here, doctor," he remarked,
      as he sat down near Bryce, after fetching glasses and soda-water. "I live
      all alone, like a hermit&mdash;my bit of work's done by a woman who only
      looks in of a morning. So we're all by ourselves. Light your cigar!&mdash;same
      as that I gave you at Barthorpe. Um&mdash;well, now," he continued, as
      Bryce settled down to listen. "There's a question I want to put to you&mdash;strictly
      between ourselves&mdash;strictest of confidence, you know. It was you who
      was called to Braden by Varner, and you were left alone with Braden's
      body?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" admitted Bryce, suddenly growing suspicious. "What of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harker edged his chair a little closer to his guest's, and leaned towards
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What," he asked in a whisper, "what have you done with that scrap of
      paper that you took out of Braden's purse?"

      CHAPTER XIV. FROM THE PAST
    </h2>
    <p>
      If any remarkably keen and able observer of the odd characteristics of
      humanity had been present in Harker's little parlour at that moment,
      watching him and his visitor, he would have been struck by what happened
      when the old man put this sudden and point-blank question to the young
      one. For Harker put the question, though in a whisper, in no more than a
      casual, almost friendlily-confidential way, and Bryce never showed by the
      start of a finger or the flicker of an eyelash that he felt it to be what
      he really knew it to be&mdash;the most surprising and startling question
      he had ever had put to him. Instead, he looked his questioner calmly in
      the eyes, and put a question in his turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are you, Mr. Harker?" asked Bryce quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harker laughed&mdash;almost gleefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you've a right to ask that!" he said. "Of course!&mdash;glad you
      take it that way. You'll do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll qualify it, then," added Bryce. "It's not who&mdash;it's what are
      you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harker waved his cigar at the book-shelves in front of which his visitor
      sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take a look at my collection of literature, doctor," he said. "What d'ye
      think of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce turned and leisurely inspected one shelf after another.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seems to consist of little else but criminal cases and legal handbooks,"
      he remarked quietly. "I begin to suspect you, Mr. Harker. They say here in
      Wrychester that you're a retired tradesman. I think you're a retired
      policeman&mdash;of the detective branch."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harker laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No Wrychester man has ever crossed my threshold since I came to settle
      down here," he said. "You're the first person I've ever asked in&mdash;with
      one notable exception. I've never even had Campany, the librarian, here.
      I'm a hermit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;you were a detective?" suggested Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aye, for a good five-and-twenty years!" replied Harker. "And pretty well
      known, too, sir. But&mdash;my question, doctor. All between ourselves!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll ask you one, then," said Bryce. "How do you know I took a scrap of
      paper from Braden's purse?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I know that he had such a paper in his purse the night he came to
      the Mitre," answered Harker, "and was certain to have it there next
      morning, and because I also know that you were left alone with the body
      for some minutes after Varner fetched you to it, and that when Braden's
      clothing and effects were searched by Mitchington, the paper wasn't there.
      So, of course, you took it! Doesn't matter to me that ye did&mdash;except
      that I know, from knowing that, that you're on a similar game to my own&mdash;which
      is why you went down to Leicestershire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You knew Braden?" asked Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew him!" answered Harker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You saw him&mdash;spoke with him&mdash;here in Wrychester?" suggested
      Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was here&mdash;in this room&mdash;in that chair&mdash;from five
      minutes past nine to close on ten o'clock the night before his death,"
      replied Harker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce, who was quietly appreciating the Havana cigar which the old man had
      given him, picked up his glass, took a drink, and settled himself in his
      easy chair as if he meant to stay there awhile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think we'd better talk confidentially, Mr. Harker," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely what we are doing, Dr. Bryce," replied Harker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, my friend," said Bryce, laconically. "Now we understand each
      other. So&mdash;do you know who John Braden really was?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes!" replied Harker, promptly. "He was in reality John Brake, ex-bank
      manager, ex-convict."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know if he's any relatives here in Wrychester?" inquired Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Harker. "The boy and girl who live with Ransford&mdash;they're
      Brake's son and daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did Brake know that&mdash;when he came here?" continued Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, he didn't&mdash;he hadn't the least idea of it," responded Harker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had you&mdash;then?" asked Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;not until later&mdash;a little later," replied Harker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You found it out at Barthorpe?" suggested Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit of it; I worked it out here&mdash;after Brake was dead," said
      Harker. "I went to Barthorpe on quite different business&mdash;Brake's
      business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Bryce. He looked the old detective quietly in the eyes. "You'd
      better tell me all about it," he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If we're both going to tell each other&mdash;all about it," stipulated
      Harker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's settled," assented Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harker smoked thoughtfully for a moment and seemed to be thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd better go back to the beginning," he said. "But, first&mdash;what do
      you know about Brake? I know you went down to Barthorpe to find out what
      you could&mdash;how far did your searches take you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that Brake married a girl from Braden Medworth, that he took her
      to London, where he was manager of a branch bank, that he got into
      trouble, and was sentenced to ten years' penal servitude," answered Bryce,
      "together with some small details into which we needn't go at present."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, as long as you know all that, there's a common basis and a common
      starting-point," remarked Harker, "so I'll begin at Brake's trial. It was
      I who arrested Brake. There was no trouble, no bother. He'd been taken
      unawares, by an inspector of the bank. He'd a considerable deficiency&mdash;couldn't
      make it good&mdash;couldn't or wouldn't explain except by half-sullen
      hints that he'd been cruelly deceived. There was no defence&mdash;couldn't
      be. His counsel said that he could&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've read the account of the trial," interrupted Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right&mdash;then you know as much as I can tell you on that point,"
      said Harker. "He got, as you say, ten years. I saw him just before he was
      removed and asked him if there was anything I could do for him about his
      wife and children. I'd never seen them&mdash;I arrested him at the bank,
      and, of course, he was never out of custody after that. He answered in a
      queer, curt way that his wife and children were being looked after. I
      heard, incidentally, that his wife had left home, or was from home&mdash;there
      was something mysterious about it&mdash;either as soon as he was arrested
      or before. Anyway, he said nothing, and from that moment I never set eyes
      on him again until I met him in the street here in Wrychester, the other
      night, when he came to the Mitre. I knew him at once&mdash;and he knew me.
      We met under one of those big standard lamps in the Market Place&mdash;I
      was following my usual practice of having an evening walk, last thing
      before going to bed. And we stopped and stared at each other. Then he came
      forward with his hand out, and we shook hands. 'This is an odd thing!' he
      said. 'You're the very man I wanted to find! Come somewhere, where it's
      quiet, and let me have a word with you.' So&mdash;I brought him here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce was all attention now&mdash;for once he was devoting all his
      faculties to tense and absorbed concentration on what another man could
      tell, leaving reflections and conclusions on what he heard until all had
      been told.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I brought him here," repeated Harker. "I told him I'd been retired and
      was living here, as he saw, alone. I asked him no questions about himself&mdash;I
      could see he was a well-dressed, apparently well-to-do man. And presently
      he began to tell me about himself. He said that after he'd finished his
      term he left England and for some time travelled in Canada and the United
      States, and had gone then&mdash;on to New Zealand and afterwards to
      Australia, where he'd settled down and begun speculating in wool. I said I
      hoped he'd done well. Yes, he said, he'd done very nicely&mdash;and then
      he gave me a quiet dig in the ribs. 'I'll tell you one thing I've done,
      Harker,' he said. 'You were very polite and considerate to me when I'd my
      trouble, so I don't mind telling you. I paid the bank every penny of that
      money they lost through my foolishness at that time&mdash;every penny,
      four years ago, with interest, and I've got their receipt.' 'Delighted to
      hear it, Mr.&mdash;Is it the same name still?' I said. 'My name ever since
      I left England,' he said, giving me a look, 'is Braden&mdash;John Braden.'
      'Yes,' he went on, 'I paid 'em&mdash;though I never had one penny of the
      money I was fool enough to take for the time being&mdash;not one
      halfpenny!' 'Who had it, Mr. Braden?' I asked him, thinking that he'd
      perhaps tell after all that time. 'Never mind, my lad!' he answered.
      'It'll come out&mdash;yet. Never mind that, now. I'll tell you why I
      wanted to see you. The fact is, I've only been a few hours in England, so
      to speak, but I'd thought of you, and wondered where I could get hold of
      you&mdash;you're the only man of your profession I ever met, you see,' he
      added, with a laugh. 'And I want a bit of help in that way.' 'Well, Mr.
      Braden,' I said, 'I've retired, but if it's an easy job&mdash;' 'It's one
      you can do, easy enough,' he said. 'It's just this&mdash;I met a man in
      Australia who's extremely anxious to get some news of another man, named
      Falkiner Wraye, who hails from Barthorpe, in Leicestershire. I promised to
      make inquiries for him. Now, I have strong reasons why I don't want to go
      near Barthorpe&mdash;Barthorpe has unpleasant memories and associations
      for me, and I don't want to be seen there. But this thing's got to be
      personal investigation&mdash;will you go here, for me? I'll make it worth
      your while. All you've got to do,' he went on, 'is to go there&mdash;see
      the police authorities, town officials, anybody that knows the place, and
      ask them if they can tell you anything of one Falkiner Wraye, who was at
      one time a small estate agent in Barthorpe, left the place about seventeen
      years ago&mdash;maybe eighteen&mdash;and is believed to have recently gone
      back to the neighbourhood. That's all. Get what information you can, and
      write it to me, care of my bankers in London. Give me a sheet of paper and
      I'll put down particulars for you.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harker paused at this point and nodded his head at an old bureau which
      stood in a corner of his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sheet of paper's there," he said. "It's got on it, in his writing, a
      brief memorandum of what he wanted and the address of his bankers. When
      he'd given it to me, he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a purse
      in which I could see he was carrying plenty of money. He took out some
      notes. 'Here's five-and-twenty pounds on account, Harker,' he said. 'You
      might have to spend a bit. Don't be afraid&mdash;plenty more where that
      comes from. You'll do it soon?' he asked. 'Yes, I'll do it, Mr. Braden,' I
      answered. 'It'll be a bit of a holiday for me.' 'That's all right,' he
      said. 'I'm delighted I came across you.' 'Well, you couldn't be more
      delighted than I was surprised,' I said. 'I never thought to see you in
      Wrychester. What brought you here, if one may ask&mdash;sight-seeing?' He
      laughed at that, and he pulled out his purse again. 'I'll show you
      something&mdash;a secret,' he said, and he took a bit of folded paper out
      of his purse. 'What do you make of that?' he asked. 'Can you read Latin?'
      'No&mdash;except a word or two,' I said, 'but I know a man who can.' 'Ah,
      never mind,' said he. 'I know enough Latin for this&mdash;and it's a
      secret. However, it won't be a secret long, and you'll hear all about it.'
      And with that he put the bit of paper in his purse again, and we began
      talking about other matters, and before long he said he'd promised to have
      a chat with a gentleman at the Mitre whom he'd come along with in the
      train, and away he went, saying he'd see me before be left the town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he say how long he was going to stop here?" asked Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two or three days," replied Harker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he mention Ransford?" inquired Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never!" said Harker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he make any reference to his wife and children?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not the slightest!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor to the hint that his counsel threw out at the trial?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never referred to that time except in the way I told you&mdash;that he
      hadn't a penny of the money, himself and that he'd himself refunded it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce meditated awhile. He was somewhat puzzled by certain points in the
      old detective's story, and he saw now that there was much more mystery in
      the Braden affair than he had at first believed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he asked, after a while, "did you see him again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not alive!" replied Harker. "I saw him dead&mdash;and I held my tongue,
      and have held it. But&mdash;something happened that day. After I heard of
      the accident, I went into the Crown and Cushion tavern&mdash;the fact was,
      I went to get a taste of whisky, for the news had upset me. And in that
      long bar of theirs, I saw a man whom I knew&mdash;a man whom I knew, for a
      fact, to have been a fellow convict of Brake's. Name of Glassdale&mdash;forgery.
      He got the same sentence that Brake got, about the same time, was in the
      same convict prison with Brake, and he and Brake would be released about
      the same date. There was no doubt about his identity&mdash;I never forget
      a face, even after thirty years I'd tell one. I saw him in that bar before
      he saw me, and I took a careful look at him. He, too, like Brake, was very
      well dressed, and very prosperous looking. He turned as he set down his
      glass, and caught sight of me&mdash;and he knew me. Mind you, he'd been
      through my hands in times past! And he instantly moved to a side-door and&mdash;vanished.
      I went out and looked up and down&mdash;he'd gone. I found out afterwards,
      by a little quiet inquiry, that he'd gone straight to the station, boarded
      the first train&mdash;there was one just giving out, to the junction&mdash;and
      left the city. But I can lay hands on him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've kept this quiet, too?" asked Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so&mdash;I've my own game to play," replied Harker. "This talk with
      you is part of it&mdash;you come in, now&mdash;I'll tell you why,
      presently. But first, as you know, I went to Barthorpe. For, though Brake
      was dead, I felt I must go&mdash;for this reason. I was certain that he
      wanted that information for himself&mdash;the man in Australia was a
      fiction. I went, then&mdash;and learned nothing. Except that this Falkiner
      Wraye had been, as Brake said, a Barthorpe man, years ago. He'd left the
      town eighteen years since, and nobody knew anything about him. So I came
      home. And now then, doctor&mdash;your turn! What were you after, down
      there at Barthorpe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce meditated his answer for a good five minutes. He had always intended
      to play the game off his own bat, but he had heard and seen enough since
      entering Harker's little room to know that he was in company with an
      intellect which was keener and more subtle than his, and that it would be
      all to his advantage to go in with the man who had vast and deep
      experience. And so he made a clean breast of all he had done in the way of
      investigation, leaving his motive completely aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've got a theory, of course?" observed Harker, after listening quietly
      to all that Bryce could tell. "Naturally, you have! You couldn't
      accumulate all that without getting one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," admitted Bryce, "honestly, I can't say that I have. But I can see
      what theory there might be. This&mdash;that Ransford was the man who
      deceived Brake, that he ran away with Brake's wife, that she's dead, and
      that he's brought up the children in ignorance of all that&mdash;and
      therefore&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And therefore," interrupted Harker with a smile, "that when he and Brake
      met&mdash;as you seem to think they did&mdash;Ransford flung Brake through
      that open doorway; that Collishaw witnessed it, that Ransford's found out
      about Collishaw, and that Collishaw has been poisoned by Ransford. Eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a theory that seems to be supported by facts," said Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a theory that would doubtless suit men like Mitchington," said the
      old detective, with another smile. "But&mdash;not me, sir! Mind you, I
      don't say there isn't something in it&mdash;there's doubtless a lot. But&mdash;the
      mystery's a lot thicker than just that. And Brake didn't come here to find
      Ransford. He came because of the secret in that scrap of paper. And as
      you've got it, doctor&mdash;out with it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce saw no reason for concealment and producing the scrap of paper laid
      it on the table between himself and his host. Harker peered inquisitively
      at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Latin!" he said. "You can read it, of course. What does it say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce repeated a literal translation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've found the place," he added. "I found it this morning. Now, what do
      you suppose this means?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harker was looking hard at the two lines of writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a big question, doctor," he answered. "But I'll go so far as to
      say this&mdash;when we've found out what it does mean, we shall know a lot
      more than we know now!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. THE DOUBLE OFFER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Bryce, who was deriving a considerable and peculiar pleasure from his
      secret interview with the old detective, smiled at Harker's last remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a bit of a platitude, isn't it?" he suggested. "Of course we shall
      know a lot more&mdash;when we do know a lot more!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I set store by platitudes, sir," retorted Harker. "You can't repeat an
      established platitude too often&mdash;it's got the hallmark of good use on
      it. But now, till we do know more&mdash;you've no doubt been thinking a
      lot about this matter, Dr. Bryce&mdash;hasn't it struck you that there's
      one feature in connection with Brake, or Braden's visit to Wrychester to
      which nobody's given any particular attention up to now&mdash;so far as we
      know, at any rate?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" demanded Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This," replied Harker. "Why did he wish to see the Duke of Saxonsteade?
      He certainly did want to see him&mdash;and as soon as possible. You'll
      remember that his Grace was questioned about that at the inquest and could
      give no explanation&mdash;he knew nothing of Brake, and couldn't suggest
      any reason why Brake should wish to have an interview with him. But&mdash;I
      can!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You?" exclaimed Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I," answered Harker. "And it's this&mdash;I spoke just now of that man
      Glassdale. Now you, of course; have no knowledge of him, and as you don't
      keep yourself posted in criminal history, you don't know what his offence
      was?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You said&mdash;forgery?" replied Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so&mdash;forgery," assented Harker. "And the signature that he
      forged was&mdash;the Duke of Saxonsteade's! As a matter of fact, he was
      the Duke's London estate agent. He got wrong, somehow, and he forged the
      Duke's name to a cheque. Now, then, considering who Glassdale is, and that
      he was certainly a fellow-convict of Brake's, and that I myself saw him
      here in Wrychester on the day of Brake's death&mdash;what's the conclusion
      to be drawn? That Brake wanted to see the Duke on some business of
      Glassdale's! Without a doubt! It may have been that he and Glassdale
      wanted to visit the Duke, together."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce silently considered this suggestion for awhile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You said, just now, that Glassdale could be traced?" he remarked at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Traced&mdash;yes," replied Harker. "So long as he's in England."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not set about it?" suggested Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not yet," said Harker. "There's things to do before that. And the first
      thing is&mdash;let's get to know what the mystery of that scrap of paper
      is. You say you've found Richard Jenkins's tomb? Very well&mdash;then the
      thing to do is to find out if anything is hidden there. Try it tomorrow
      night. Better go by yourself&mdash;after dark. If you find anything, let
      me know. And then&mdash;then we can decide on a next step. But between now
      and then, there'll be the inquest on this man Collishaw. And, about that&mdash;a
      word in your ear! Say as little as ever you can!&mdash;after all, you know
      nothing beyond what you saw. And&mdash;we mustn't meet and talk in public&mdash;after
      you've done that bit of exploring in Paradise tomorrow night, come round
      here and we'll consider matters."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was little that Bryce could say or could be asked to say at the
      inquest on the mason's labourer next morning. Public interest and
      excitement was as keen about Collishaw's mysterious death as about
      Braden's, for it was already rumoured through the town that if Braden had
      not met with his death when he came to Wrychester, Collishaw would still
      be alive. The Coroner's court was once more packed; once more there was
      the same atmosphere of mystery. But the proceedings were of a very
      different nature to those which had attended the inquest on Braden. The
      foreman under whose orders Collishaw had been working gave particulars of
      the dead man's work on the morning of his death. He had been instructed to
      clear away an accumulation of rubbish which had gathered at the foot of
      the south wall of the nave in consequence of some recent repairs to the
      masonry&mdash;there was a full day's work before him. All day he would be
      in and out of Paradise with his barrow, wheeling away the rubbish he
      gathered up. The foreman had looked in on him once or twice; he had seen
      him just before noon, when he appeared to be in his usual health&mdash;he
      had made no complaint, at any rate. Asked if he had happened to notice
      where Collishaw had set down his dinner basket and his tin bottle while he
      worked, he replied that it so happened that he had&mdash;he remembered
      seeing both bottle and basket and the man's jacket deposited on one of the
      box-tombs under a certain yew-tree&mdash;which he could point out, if
      necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce's account of his finding of Collishaw amounted to no more than a
      bare recital of facts. Nor was much time spent in questioning the two
      doctors who had conducted the post-mortem examination. Their evidence,
      terse and particular, referred solely to the cause of death. The man had
      been poisoned by a dose of hydrocyanic acid, which, in their opinion, had
      been taken only a few minutes before his body was discovered by Dr. Bryce.
      It had probably been a dose which would cause instantaneous death. There
      were no traces of the poison in the remains of his dinner, nor in the
      liquid in his tin bottle, which was old tea. But of the cause of his
      sudden death there was no more doubt than of the effects. Ransford had
      been in the court from the outset of the proceedings, and when the medical
      evidence had been given he was called. Bryce, watching him narrowly, saw
      that he was suffering from repressed excitement&mdash;and that that
      excitement was as much due to anger as to anything else. His face was set
      and stern, and he looked at the Coroner with an expression which portended
      something not precisely clear at that moment. Bryce, trying to analyse it,
      said to himself that he shouldn't be surprised if a scene followed&mdash;Ransford
      looked like a man who is bursting to say something in no unmistakable
      fashion. But at first he answered the questions put to him calmly and
      decisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When this man's clothing was searched," observed the Coroner, "a box of
      pills was found, Dr. Ransford, on which your writing appears. Had you been
      attending him&mdash;professionally?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," replied Ransford. "Both Collishaw and his wife. Or, rather, to be
      exact, I had been in attendance on the wife, for some weeks. A day or two
      before his death, Collishaw complained to me of indigestion, following on
      his meals. I gave him some digestive pills&mdash;the pills you speak of,
      no doubt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "These?" asked the Coroner, passing over the box which Mitchington had
      found.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely!" agreed Ransford. "That, at any rate, is the box, and I
      suppose those to be the pills."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You made them up yourself?" inquired the Coroner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did&mdash;I dispense all my own medicines."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it possible that the poison we have beard of, just now, could get into
      one of those pills&mdash;by accident?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Utterly impossible!&mdash;under my hands, at any rate," answered
      Ransford.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still, I suppose, it could have been administered in a pill?" suggested
      the Coroner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It might," agreed Ransford. "But," he added, with a significant glance at
      the medical men who had just given evidence. "It was not so administered
      in this case, as the previous witnesses very well know!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Coroner looked round him, and waited a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are at liberty to explain&mdash;that last remark," he said at last.
      "That is&mdash;if you wish to do so." "Certainly!" answered Ransford, with
      alacrity. "Those pills are, as you will observe, coated, and the man would
      swallow them whole&mdash;immediately after his food. Now, it would take
      some little time for a pill to dissolve, to disintegrate, to be digested.
      If Collishaw took one of my pills as soon as he had eaten his dinner,
      according to instructions, and if poison had been in that pill, he would
      not have died at once&mdash;as he evidently did. Death would probably have
      been delayed some little time until the pill had dissolved. But, according
      to the evidence you have had before you, he died quite suddenly while
      eating his dinner&mdash;or immediately after it. I am not legally
      represented here&mdash;I don't consider it at all necessary&mdash;but I
      ask you to recall Dr. Coates and to put this question to him: Did he find
      one of those digestive pills in this man's stomach?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Coroner turned, somewhat dubiously, to the two doctors who had
      performed the autopsy. But before he could speak, the superintendent of
      police rose and began to whisper to him, and after a conversation between
      them, he looked round at the jury, every member of which had evidently
      been much struck by Ransford's suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At this stage," he said, "it will be necessary to adjourn. I shall
      adjourn the inquiry for a week, gentlemen. You will&mdash;" Ransford,
      still standing in the witness-box, suddenly lost control of himself. He
      uttered a sharp exclamation and smote the ledge before him smartly with
      his open hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I protest against that!" he said vehemently. "Emphatically, I protest!
      You first of all make a suggestion which tells against me&mdash;then, when
      I demand that a question shall be put which is of immense importance to my
      interests, you close down the inquiry&mdash;even if only for the moment.
      That is grossly unfair and unjust!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are mistaken," said the Coroner. "At the adjourned inquiry, the two
      medical men can be recalled, and you will have the opportunity&mdash;or
      your solicitor will have&mdash;of asking any questions you like for the
      present&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the present you have me under suspicion!" interrupted Ransford hotly.
      "You know it&mdash;I say this with due respect to your office&mdash;as
      well as I do. Suspicion is rife in the city against me. Rumour is being
      spread&mdash;secretly&mdash;and, I am certain&mdash;from the police, who
      ought to know better. And&mdash;I will not be silenced, Mr. Coroner!&mdash;I
      take this public opportunity, as I am on oath, of saying that I know
      nothing whatever of the causes of the deaths of either Collishaw or of
      Braden&mdash;upon my solemn oath!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The inquest is adjourned to this day week," said the Coroner quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford suddenly stepped down from the witness-box and without word or
      glance at any one there, walked with set face and determined look out of
      the court, and the excited spectators, gathering into groups, immediately
      began to discuss his vigorous outburst and to take sides for and against
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce, judging it advisable to keep away from Mitchington just then, and,
      for similar reasons, keeping away from Harker also, went out of the
      crowded building alone&mdash;to be joined in the street outside by
      Sackville Bonham, whom he had noticed in court, in company with his
      stepfather, Mr. Folliot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Folliot, Bryce had observed, had stopped behind, exchanging some
      conversation with the Coroner. Sackville came up to Bryce with a knowing
      shake of the hand. He was one of those very young men who have a habit of
      suggesting that their fund of knowledge is extensive and peculiar, and
      Bryce waited for a manifestation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Queer business, all that, Bryce!" observed Sackville confidentially. "Of
      course, Ransford is a perfect ass!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think so?" remarked Bryce, with an inflection which suggested that
      Sackville's opinion on anything was as valuable as the Attorney-General's.
      "That's how it strikes you, is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible that it could strike one in any other way, you know," answered
      Sackville with fine and lofty superiority. "Ransford should have taken
      immediate steps to clear himself of any suspicion. It's ridiculous,
      considering his position&mdash;guardian to&mdash;to Miss Bewery, for
      instance&mdash;that he should allow such rumours to circulate. By God,
      sir, if it had been me, I'd have stopped 'em!&mdash;before they left the
      parish pump!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah?" said Bryce. "And&mdash;how?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Made an example of somebody," replied Sackville, with emphasis. "I
      believe there's law in this country, isn't there?&mdash;law against libel
      and slander, and that sort of thing, eh? Oh, yes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not been much time for that&mdash;yet," remarked Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Piles of time," retorted Sackville, swinging his stick vigorously. "No,
      sir, Ransford is an ass! However, if a man won't do things for himself,
      well, his friends must do something for him. Ransford, of course, must be
      pulled&mdash;dragged!&mdash;out of this infernal hole. Of course he's
      suspected! But my stepfather&mdash;he's going to take a hand. And my
      stepfather, Bryce, is a devilish cute old hand at a game of this sort!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobody doubts Mr. Folliot's abilities, I'm sure," said Bryce. "But&mdash;you
      don't mind saying&mdash;how is he going to take a hand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stir things towards a clearing-up," announced Sackville promptly. "Have
      the whole thing gone into&mdash;thoroughly. There are matters that haven't
      been touched on, yet. You'll see, my boy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad to hear it," said Bryce. "But&mdash;why should Mr. Folliot be so
      particular about clearing Ransford?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sackville swung his stick, and pulled up his collar, and jerked his nose a
      trifle higher.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well," he said. "Of course, it's&mdash;it's a pretty well understood
      thing, don't you know&mdash;between myself and Miss Bewery, you know&mdash;and
      of course, we couldn't have any suspicions attaching to her guardian,
      could we, now? Family interest, don't you know&mdash;Caesar's wife, and
      all that sort of thing, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," answered Bryce, quietly,&mdash;"sort of family arrangement. With
      Ransford's consent and knowledge, of course?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ransford won't even be consulted," said Sackville, airily. "My stepfather&mdash;sharp
      man, that, Bryce!&mdash;he'll do things in his own fashion. You look out
      for sudden revelations!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will," replied Bryce. "By-bye!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned off to his rooms, wondering how much of truth there was in the
      fatuous Sackville's remarks. And&mdash;was there some mystery still
      undreamt of by himself and Harker? There might be&mdash;he was still under
      the influence of Ransford's indignant and dramatic assertion of his
      innocence. Would Ransford have allowed himself an outburst of that sort if
      he had not been, as he said, utterly ignorant of the immediate cause of
      Braden's death? Now Bryce, all through, was calculating, for his own
      purposes, on Ransford's share, full or partial, in that death&mdash;if
      Ransford really knew nothing whatever about it, where did his, Bryce's
      theory, come in&mdash;and how would his present machinations result? And,
      more&mdash;if Ransford's assertion were true, and if Varner's story of the
      hand, seen for an instant in the archway, were also true&mdash;and Varner
      was persisting in it&mdash;then, who was the man who flung Braden to his
      death that morning? He realized that, instead of straightening out, things
      were becoming more and more complicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he realized something else. On the surface, there was a strong case of
      suspicion against Ransford. It had been suggested that very morning before
      a coroner and his jury; it would grow; the police were already permeated
      with suspicion and distrust. Would it not pay him, Bryce, to encourage, to
      help it? He had his own score to pay off against Ransford; he had his own
      schemes as regards Mary Bewery. Anyway, he was not going to share in any
      attempts to clear the man who had bundled him out of his house
      unceremoniously&mdash;he would bide his time. And in the meantime there
      were other things to be done&mdash;one of them that very night.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before Bryce could engage in his secret task of excavating a small
      portion of Paradise in the rear of Richard Jenkins's tomb, another strange
      development came. As the dark fell over the old city that night and he was
      thinking of setting out on his mission, Mitchington came in, carrying two
      sheets of paper, obviously damp from the press, in his hand. He looked at
      Bryce with an expression of wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's a queer go!" he said. "I can't make this out at all! Look at these
      big handbills&mdash;but perhaps you've seen 'em? They're being posted all
      over the city&mdash;we've had a bundle of 'em thrown in on us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't been out since lunch," remarked Bryce. "What are they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington spread out the two papers on the table, pointing from one to
      the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see?" he said. "Five Hundred Pounds Reward!&mdash;One Thousand Pounds
      Reward! And&mdash;both out at the same time, from different sources!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What sources?" asked Bryce, bending over the bills. "Ah&mdash;I see. One
      signed by Phipps &amp; Maynard, the other by Beachcroft. Odd, certainly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Odd?" exclaimed Mitchington. "I should think so! But, do you see, doctor?
      that one&mdash;five hundred reward&mdash;is offered for information of any
      nature relative to the deaths of John Braden and James Collishaw, both or
      either. That amount will be paid for satisfactory information by Phipps
      &amp; Maynard. And Phipps &amp; Maynard are Ransford's solicitors! That
      bill, sir, comes from him! And now the other, the thousand pound one, that
      offers the reward to any one who can give definite information as to the
      circumstances attending the death of John Braden&mdash;to be paid by Mr.
      Beachcroft. And he's Mr. Folliot's solicitor! So&mdash;that comes from Mr.
      Folliot. What has he to do with it? And are these two putting their heads
      together&mdash;or are these bills quite independent of each other? Hang me
      if I understand it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce read and re-read the contents of the two bills. And then he thought
      for awhile before speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he said at last, "there's probably this in it&mdash;the Folliots
      are very wealthy people. Mrs. Folliot, it's pretty well known, wants her
      son to marry Miss Bewery&mdash;Dr. Ransford's ward. Probably she doesn't
      wish any suspicion to hang over the family. That's all I can suggest. In
      the other case, Ransford wants to clear himself. For don't forget this,
      Mitchington!&mdash;somewhere, somebody may know something! Only something.
      But that something might clear Ransford of the suspicion that's
      undoubtedly been cast upon him. If you're thinking to get a strong case
      against Ransford, you've got your work set. He gave your theory a nasty
      knock this morning by his few words about that pill. Did Coates and
      Everest find a pill, now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at liberty to say, sir," answered Mitchington. "At present, anyway.
      Um! I dislike these private offers of reward&mdash;it means that those who
      make 'em get hold of information which is kept back from us, d'you see!
      They're inconvenient."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he went away, and Bryce, after waiting awhile, until night had
      settled down, slipped quietly out of the house and set off for the gloom
      of Paradise.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. BEFOREHAND
    </h2>
    <p>
      In accordance with his undeniable capacity for contriving and scheming,
      Bryce had made due and careful preparations for his visit to the tomb of
      Richard Jenkins. Even in the momentary confusion following upon his
      discovery of Collishaw's dead body, he had been sufficiently alive to his
      own immediate purposes to notice that the tomb&mdash;a very ancient and
      dilapidated structure&mdash;stood in the midst of a small expanse of stone
      pavement between the yew-trees and the wall of the nave; he had noticed
      also that the pavement consisted of small squares of stone, some of which
      bore initials and dates. A sharp glance at the presumed whereabouts of the
      particular spot which he wanted, as indicated in the scrap of paper taken
      from Braden's purse, showed him that he would have to raise one of those
      small squares&mdash;possibly two or three of them. And so he had furnished
      himself with a short crowbar of tempered steel, specially purchased at the
      iron-monger's, and with a small bull's-eye lantern. Had he been arrested
      and searched as he made his way towards the cathedral precincts he might
      reasonably have been suspected of a design to break into the treasury and
      appropriate the various ornaments for which Wrychester was famous. But
      Bryce feared neither arrest nor observation. During his residence in
      Wrychester he had done a good deal of prowling about the old city at
      night, and he knew that Paradise, at any time after dark, was a deserted
      place. Folk might cross from the close archway to the wicket-gate by the
      outer path, but no one would penetrate within the thick screen of yew and
      cypress when night had fallen. And now, in early summer, the screen of
      trees and bushes was so thick in leaf, that once within it, foliage on one
      side, the great walls of the nave on the other, there was little
      likelihood of any person overlooking his doings while he made his
      investigation. He anticipated a swift and quiet job, to be done in a few
      minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was another individual in Wrychester who knew just as much of
      the geography of Paradise as Pemberton Bryce knew. Dick Bewery and Betty
      Campany had of late progressed out of the schoolboy and schoolgirl
      hail-fellow-well-met stage to the first dawnings of love, and in spite of
      their frequent meetings had begun a romantic correspondence between each
      other, the joy and mystery of which was increased a hundredfold by a
      secret method of exchange of these missives. Just within the wicket-gate
      entrance of Paradise there was an old monument wherein was a convenient
      cavity&mdash;Dick Bewery's ready wits transformed this into love's
      post-office. In it he regularly placed letters for Betty: Betty stuffed
      into it letters for him. And on this particular evening Dick had gone to
      Paradise to collect a possible mail, and as Bryce walked leisurely up the
      narrow path, enclosed by trees and old masonry which led from Friary Lane
      to the ancient enclosure, Dick turned a corner and ran full into him. In
      the light of the single lamp which illumined the path, the two recovered
      themselves and looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hullo!" said Bryce. "What's your hurry, young Bewery?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick, who was panting for breath, more from excitement than haste, drew
      back and looked at Bryce. Up to then he knew nothing much against Bryce,
      whom he had rather liked in the fashion in which boys sometimes like their
      seniors, and he was not indisposed to confide in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hullo!" he replied. "I say! Where are you off to?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nowhere!&mdash;strolling round," answered Bryce. "No particular purpose,
      why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You weren't going in&mdash;there?" asked Dick, jerking a thumb towards
      Paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In&mdash;there!" exclaimed Bryce. "Good Lord, no!&mdash;dreary enough in
      the daytime! What should I be going in there for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick seized Bryce's coat-sleeve and dragged him aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say!" he whispered. "There's something up in there&mdash;a search of
      some sort!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce started in spite of an effort to keep unconcerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A search? In there?" he said. "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick pointed amongst the trees, and Bryce saw the faint glimmer of a
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was in there&mdash;just now," said Dick. "And some men&mdash;three or
      four&mdash;came along. They're in there, close up by the nave, just where
      you found that chap Collishaw. They're&mdash;digging&mdash;or something of
      that sort!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Digging!" muttered Bryce. "Digging?"'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something like it, anyhow," replied Dick. "Listen."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce heard the ring of metal on stone. And an unpleasant conviction stole
      over him that he was being forestalled, that somebody was beforehand with
      him, and he cursed himself for not having done the previous night what he
      had left undone till this night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are they?" he asked. "Did you see them&mdash;their faces?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not their faces," answered Dick. "Only their figures in the gloom. But I
      heard Mitchington's voice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Police, then!" said Bryce. "What on earth are they after?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here!" whispered Dick, pulling at Bryce's arm again. "Come on! I
      know how to get in there without their seeing us. You follow me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce followed readily, and Dick stepping through the wicket-gate, seized
      his companion's wrist and led him amongst the bushes in the direction of
      the spot from whence came the metallic sounds. He walked with the step of
      a cat, and Bryce took pains to follow his example. And presently from
      behind a screen of cypresses they looked out on the expanse of flagging in
      the midst of which stood the tomb of Richard Jenkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Round about that tomb were five men whose faces were visible enough in the
      light thrown by a couple of strong lamps, one of which stood on the tomb
      itself, while the other was set on the ground. Four out of the five the
      two watchers recognized at once. One, kneeling on the flags, and busy with
      a small crowbar similar to that which Bryce carried inside his overcoat,
      was the master-mason of the cathedral. Another, standing near him, was
      Mitchington. A third was a clergyman&mdash;one of the lesser dignitaries
      of the Chapter. A fourth&mdash;whose presence made Bryce start for the
      second time that evening&mdash;was the Duke of Saxonsteade. But the fifth
      was a stranger&mdash;a tall man who stood between Mitchington and the
      Duke, evidently paying anxious attention to the master-mason's
      proceedings. He was no Wrychester man&mdash;Bryce was convinced of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      And a moment later he was convinced of another equally certain fact.
      Whatever these five men were searching for, they had no clear or accurate
      idea of its exact whereabouts. The master-mason was taking up the small
      squares of flagstone with his crowbar one by one, from the outer edge of
      the foot of the old box-tomb; as he removed each, he probed the earth
      beneath it. And Bryce, who had instinctively realized what was happening,
      and knew that somebody else than himself was in possession of the secret
      of the scrap of paper, saw that it would be some time before they arrived
      at the precise spot indicated in the Latin directions. He quietly drew
      back and tugged at Dick Bewery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop here, and keep quiet!" he whispered when they had retreated out of
      all danger of being overheard. "Watch 'em! I want to fetch somebody&mdash;want
      to know who that stranger is. You don't know him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never seen him before," replied Dick. "I say!&mdash;come quietly back&mdash;don't
      give it away. I want to know what it's all about."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce squeezed the lad's arm by way of assurance and made his way back
      through the bushes. He wanted to get hold of Harker, and at once, and he
      hurried round to the old man's house and without ceremony walked into his
      parlour. Harker, evidently expecting him, and meanwhile amusing himself
      with his pipe and book, rose from his chair as the younger man entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Found anything?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We're done!" answered Bryce. "I was a fool not to go last night! We're
      forestalled, my friend!&mdash;that's about it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By&mdash;whom?" inquired Harker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are five of them at it, now," replied Bryce. "Mitchington, a mason,
      one of the cathedral clergy, a stranger, and the Duke of Saxonsteade! What
      do you think of that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harker suddenly started as if a new light had dawned on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Duke!" he exclaimed. "You don't say so! My conscience!&mdash;now, I
      wonder if that can really be? Upon my word, I'd never thought of it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thought of what?" demanded Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind! tell you later," said Harker. "At present, is there any
      chance of getting a look at them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what I came for," retorted Bryce. "I've been watching them, with
      young Bewery. He put me up to it. Come on! I want to see if you know the
      man who's a stranger."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harker crossed the room to a chest of drawers, and after some rummaging
      pulled something out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here!" he said, handing some articles to Bryce. "Put those on over your
      boots. Thick felt overshoes&mdash;you could walk round your own mother's
      bedroom in those and she'd never hear you. I'll do the same. A stranger,
      you say? Well, this is a proof that somebody knows the secret of that
      scrap of paper besides us, doctor!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They don't know the exact spot," growled Bryce, who was chafing at having
      been done out of his discovery. "But, they'll find it, whatever may be
      there."
    </p>
    <p>
      He led Harker back to Paradise and to the place where he had left Dick
      Bewery, whom they approached so quietly that Bryce was by the lad's side
      before Dick knew he was there. And Harker, after one glance at the ring of
      faces, drew Bryce back and put his lips close to his ear and breathed a
      name in an almost imperceptible yet clear whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glassdale!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce started for the third time. Glassdale!&mdash;the man whom Harker had
      seen in Wrychester within an hour or so of Braden's death: the ex-convict,
      the forger, who had forged the Duke of Saxonsteade's name! And there!
      standing, apparently quite at his ease, by the Duke's side. What did it
      all mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no explanation of what it meant to be had from the man whom
      Bryce and Harker and Dick Bewery secretly watched from behind the screen
      of cypress trees. Four of them watched in silence, or with no more than a
      whispered word now and then while the fifth worked. This man worked
      methodically, replacing each stone as he took it up and examined the soil
      beneath it. So far nothing had resulted, but he was by that time working
      at some distance from the tomb, and Bryce, who had an exceedingly accurate
      idea of where the spot might be, as indicated in the measurements on the
      scrap of paper, nudged Harker as the master-mason began to take up the
      last of the small flags. And suddenly there was a movement amongst the
      watchers, and the master-mason looked up from his job and motioned
      Mitchington to pass him a trowel which lay at a little distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something here!" he said, loudly enough to reach the ears of Bryce and
      his companions. "Not so deep down, neither, gentlemen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A few vigorous applications of the trowel, a few lumps of earth cast out
      of the cavity, and the master-mason put in his hand and drew forth a small
      parcel, which in the light of the lamp held close to it by Mitchington
      looked to be done up in coarse sacking, secured by great blotches of black
      sealing wax. And now it was Harker who nudged Bryce, drawing his attention
      to the fact that the parcel, handed by the master-mason to Mitchington was
      at once passed on by Mitchington to the Duke of Saxonsteade, who, it was
      very plain to see, appeared to be as much delighted as surprised at
      receiving it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us go to your office, inspector," he said. "We'll examine the
      contents there. Let us all go at once!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The three figures behind the cypress trees remained immovable and silent
      until the five searchers had gone away with their lamps and tools and the
      sound of their retreating footsteps in Friary Lane had died out. Then Dick
      Bewery moved and began to slip off, and Bryce reached out a hand and took
      him by the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, Bewery!" he said. "Going to tell all that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harker got in a word before Dick could answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No matter if he does, doctor," he remarked quietly. "Whatever it is, the
      whole town'll know of it by tomorrow. They'll not keep it back."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce let Dick go, and the boy immediately darted off in the direction of
      the close, while the two men went towards Harker's house. Neither spoke
      until they were safe in the old detective's little parlour, then Harker,
      turning up his lamp, looked at Bryce and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a good job I've retired!" he said, almost sadly. "I'm getting too
      old for my trade, doctor. Once upon a time I should have been fit to kick
      myself for not having twigged the meaning of this business sooner than I
      have done!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you twigged it?" demanded Bryce, almost scornfully. "You're a good
      deal cleverer than I am if you have. For hang me if I know what it means!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do!" answered Harker. He opened a drawer in his desk and drew out a
      scrap-book, filled, as Bryce saw a moment later, with cuttings from
      newspapers, all duly arranged and indexed. The old man glanced at the
      index, turned to a certain page, and put his finger on an entry. "There
      you are!" he said. "And that's only one&mdash;there are several more.
      They'll tell you in detail what I can tell you in a few words and what I
      ought to have remembered. It's fifteen years since the famous robbery at
      Saxonsteade which has never been accounted for&mdash;robbery of the
      Duchess's diamonds&mdash;one of the cleverest burglaries ever known,
      doctor. They were got one night after a grand ball there; no arrest was
      ever made, they were never traced. And I'll lay all I'm worth to a
      penny-piece that the Duke and those men are gladding their eyes with the
      sight of them just now!&mdash;in Mitchington's office&mdash;and that the
      information that they were where they've just been found was given to the
      Duke by&mdash;Glassdale!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glassdale! That man!" exclaimed Bryce, who was puzzling his brain over
      possible developments.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That man, sir!" repeated Harker. "That's why Glassdale was in Wrychester
      the day of Braden's death. And that's why Braden, or Brake, came to
      Wrychester at all. He and Glassdale, of course, had somehow come into
      possession of the secret, and no doubt meant to tell the Duke together,
      and get the reward&mdash;there was 95,000 offered! And as Brake's dead,
      Glassdale's spoken, but"&mdash;here the old man paused and gave his
      companion a shrewd look&mdash;"the question still remains: How did Brake
      come to his end?"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. TO BE SHADOWED
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dick Bewery burst in upon his sister and Ransford with a budget of news
      such as it rarely fell to the lot of romance-loving seventeen to tell.
      Secret and mysterious digging up of grave-yards by night&mdash;discovery
      of sealed packets, the contents of which might only be guessed at&mdash;the
      whole thing observed by hidden spectators&mdash;these were things he had
      read of in fiction, but had never expected to have the luck to see in real
      life. And being gifted with some powers of imagination and of narrative,
      he made the most of his story to a pair of highly attentive listeners,
      each of whom had his, and her, own reasons for particular attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      "More mystery!" remarked Mary when Dick's story had come to an end. "What
      a pity they didn't open the parcel!" She looked at Ransford, who was
      evidently in deep thought. "I suppose it will all come out?" she
      suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure to!" he answered, and turned to Dick. "You say Bryce fetched old
      Harker&mdash;after you and Bryce had watched these operations a bit? Did
      he say why he fetched him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never said anything as to his reasons," answered Dick. "But, I rather
      guessed, at the end, that Bryce wanted me to keep quiet about it, only old
      Harker said there was no need."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford made no comment on this, and Dick, having exhausted his stock of
      news, presently went off to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Master Bryce," observed Ransford, after a period of silence, "is playing
      a game! What it is, I don't know&mdash;but I'm certain of it. Well, we
      shall see! You've been much upset by all this," he went on, after another
      pause, "and the knowledge that you have has distressed me beyond measure!
      But just have a little&mdash;a very little&mdash;more patience, and things
      will be cleared&mdash;I can't tell all that's in my mind, even to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary, who had been sewing while Ransford, as was customary with him in an
      evening, read the Times to her, looked down at her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shouldn't care, if only these rumours in the town&mdash;about you&mdash;could
      be crushed!" she said. "It's so cruel, so vile, that such things&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford snapped his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't care that about the rumours!" he answered, contemptuously.
      "They'll be crushed out just as suddenly as they arose&mdash;and then,
      perhaps, I'll let certain folk in Wrychester know what I think of them.
      And as regards the suspicion against me, I know already that the only
      people in the town for whose opinion I care fully accept what I said
      before the Coroner. As to the others, let them talk! If the thing comes to
      a head before its due time&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You make me think that you know more&mdash;much more!&mdash;than you've
      ever told me!" interrupted Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I do!" he replied. "And you'll see in the end why I've kept silence.
      Of course, if people who don't know as much will interfere&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was interrupted there by the ringing of the front door bell, at the
      sound of which he and Mary looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who can that be?" said Mary. "It's past ten o'clock."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford offered no suggestion. He sat silently waiting, until the
      parlourmaid entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Inspector Mitchington would be much obliged if you could give him a few
      minutes, sir," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford got up from his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take Inspector Mitchington into the study," he said. "Is he alone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir&mdash;there's a gentleman with him," replied the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right&mdash;I'll be with them presently," answered Ransford. "Take
      them both in there and light the gas. Police!" he went on, when the
      parlourmaid had gone. "They get hold of the first idea that strikes them,
      and never even look round for another, You're not frightened?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Frightened&mdash;no! Uneasy&mdash;yes!" replied Mary. "What can they
      want, this time of night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Probably to tell me something about this romantic tale of Dick's,"
      answered Ransford, as he left the room. "It'll be nothing more serious, I
      assure you."
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was not so sure of that. He was very well aware that the Wrychester
      police authorities had a definite suspicion of his guilt in the Braden and
      Collishaw matters, and he knew from experience that police suspicion is a
      difficult matter to dissipate. And before he opened the door of the little
      room which he used as a study he warned himself to be careful&mdash;and
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two visitors stood near the hearth&mdash;Ransford took a good look at
      them as he closed the door behind him. Mitchington he knew well enough; he
      was more interested in the other man, a stranger. A quiet-looking, very
      ordinary individual, who might have been half a dozen things&mdash;but
      Ransford instantly set him down as a detective. He turned from this man to
      the inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" he said, a little brusquely. "What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry to intrude so late, Dr. Ransford," answered Mitchington, "but I
      should be much obliged if you would give us a bit of information&mdash;badly
      wanted, doctor, in view of recent events," he added, with a smile which
      was meant to be reassuring. "I'm sure you can&mdash;if you will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down," said Ransford, pointing to chairs. He took one himself and
      again glanced at the stranger. "To whom am I speaking, in addition to
      yourself, Inspector?" he asked. "I'm not going to talk to strangers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well!" said Mitchington, a little awkwardly. "Of course, doctor,
      we've had to get a bit of professional help in these unpleasant matters.
      This gentleman's Detective-Sergeant Jettison, from the Yard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What information do you want?" asked Ransford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington glanced at the door and lowered his voice. "I may as well tell
      you, doctor," he said confidentially, "there's been a most extraordinary
      discovery made tonight, which has a bearing on the Braden case. I dare say
      you've heard of the great jewel robbery which took place at the Duke of
      Saxonsteade's some years ago, which has been a mystery to this very day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have heard of it," answered Ransford.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well&mdash;tonight those jewels&mdash;the whole lot!&mdash;have been
      discovered in Paradise yonder, where they'd been buried, at the time of
      the robbery, by the thief," continued Mitchington. "They've just been
      examined, and they're now in the Duke's own hands again&mdash;after all
      these years! And&mdash;I may as well tell you&mdash;we now know that the
      object of Braden's visit to Wrychester was to tell the Duke where those
      jewels were hidden. Braden&mdash;and another man&mdash;had learned the
      secret, from the real thief, who's dead in Australia. All that I may tell
      you, doctor&mdash;for it'll be public property tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" said Ransford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington hesitated a moment, as if searching for his next words. He
      glanced at the detective; the detective remained immobile; he glanced at
      Ransford; Ransford gave him no encouragement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now look here, doctor!" he exclaimed, suddenly. "Why not tell us
      something? We know now who Braden really was! That's settled. Do you
      understand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who was he, then?" asked Ransford, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was one John Brake, some time manager of a branch of a London bank,
      who, seventeen years ago, got ten years' penal servitude for
      embezzlement," answered Mitchington, watching Ransford steadily. "That's
      dead certain&mdash;we know it! The man who shared this secret with him
      about the Saxonsteade jewels has told us that much, today. John Brake!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have you come here for?" asked Ransford.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To ask you&mdash;between ourselves&mdash;if you can tell us anything
      about Brake's earlier days&mdash;antecedents&mdash;that'll help us,"
      replied Mitchington. "It may be&mdash;Jettison here&mdash;a man of
      experience&mdash;thinks it'll be found to be&mdash;that Brake, or Braden
      as we call him&mdash;was murdered because of his possession of that secret
      about the jewels. Our informant tells us that Braden certainly had on him,
      when he came to Wrychester, a sort of diagram showing the exact location
      of the spot where the jewels were hidden&mdash;that diagram was most
      assuredly not found on Braden when we examined his clothing and effects.
      It may be that it was wrested from him in the gallery of the clerestory
      that morning, and that his assailant, or assailants&mdash;for there may
      have been two men at the job&mdash;afterwards pitched him through that
      open doorway, after half-stifling him. And if that theory's correct&mdash;and
      I, personally, am now quite inclined to it&mdash;it'll help a lot if
      you'll tell us what you know of Braden's&mdash;Brake's&mdash;antecedents.
      Come now, doctor!&mdash;you know very well that Braden, or Brake, did come
      to your surgery that morning and said to your assistant that he'd known a
      Dr. Ransford in times past! Why not speak?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford, instead of answering Mitchington's evidently genuine appeal,
      looked at the New Scotland Yard man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that your theory?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jettison nodded his head, with a movement indicative of conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir!" he replied. "Having regard to all the circumstances of the
      case, as they've been put before me since I came here, and with special
      regard to the revelations which have resulted in the discovery of these
      jewels, it is! Of course, today's events have altered everything. If it
      hadn't been for our informant&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is your informant?" inquired Ransford.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two callers looked at each other&mdash;the detective nodded at the
      inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well!" said Mitchington. "No harm in telling you, doctor. A man named
      Glassdale&mdash;once a fellow-convict with Brake. It seems they left
      England together after their time was up, emigrated together, prospered,
      even went so far&mdash;both of 'em!&mdash;as to make good the money they'd
      appropriated, and eventually came back together&mdash;in possession of
      this secret. Brake came specially to Wrychester to tell the Duke&mdash;Glassdale
      was to join him on the very morning Brake met his death. Glassdale did
      come to the town that morning&mdash;and as soon as he got here, heard of
      Brake's strange death. That upset him&mdash;and he went away&mdash;only to
      come back today, go to Saxonsteade, and tell everything to the Duke&mdash;with
      the result we've told you of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which result," remarked Ransford, steadily regarding Mitchington, "has
      apparently altered all your ideas about&mdash;me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington laughed a little awkwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well, come, now, doctor!" he said. "Why, yes&mdash;frankly, I'm
      inclined to Jettison's theory&mdash;in fact, I'm certain that's the
      truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And your theory," inquired Ransford, turning to the detective, "is&mdash;put
      it in a few words."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My theory&mdash;and I'll lay anything it's the correct one!&mdash;is
      this," replied Jettison. "Brake came to Wrychester with his secret. That
      secret wasn't confined to him and Glassdale&mdash;either he let it out to
      somebody, or it was known to somebody. I understand from Inspector
      Mitchington here that on the evening of his arrival Brake was away from
      the Mitre Hotel for two hours. During that time, he was somewhere&mdash;with
      whom? Probably with somebody who got the secret out of him, or to whom he
      communicated it. For, think!&mdash;according to Glassdale, who, we are
      quite sure, has told the exact truth about everything, Brake had on him a
      scrap of paper, on which were instructions, in Latin, for finding the
      exact spot whereat the missing Saxonsteade jewels had been hidden, years
      before, by the actual thief&mdash;who, I may tell you, sir, never had the
      opportunity of returning to re-possess himself of them. Now, after Brake's
      death, the police examined his clothes and effects&mdash;they never found
      that scrap of paper! And I work things out this way. Brake was followed
      into that gallery&mdash;a lonely, quiet place&mdash;by the man or men who
      had got possession of the secret; he was, I'm told, a slightly-built, not
      over-strong man&mdash;he was seized and robbed of that paper and flung to
      his death. And all that fits in with the second mystery of Collishaw&mdash;who
      probably knew, if not everything, then something, of the exact
      circumstances of Brake's death, and let his knowledge get to the ears of&mdash;Brake's
      assailant!&mdash;who cleverly got rid of him. That's my notion," concluded
      the detective. "And&mdash;I shall be surprised if it isn't a correct one!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, as I've said, doctor," chimed in Mitchington, "can't you give us a
      bit of information, now? You see the line we're on? Now, as it's evident
      you once knew Braden, or Brake&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have never said so!" interrupted Ransford sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;we infer it, from the undoubted fact that he called here,"
      remarked Mitchington. "And if&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait!" said Ransford. He had been listening with absorbed attention to
      Jettison's theory, and he now rose from his chair and began to pace the
      room, hands in pockets, as if in deep thought. Suddenly he paused and
      looked at Mitchington. "This needs some reflection," he said. "Are you
      pressed for time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not in the least," answered Mitchington, readily. "Our time's yours, sir.
      Take as long as you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford touched a bell and summoning the parlourmaid told her to fetch
      whisky, soda, and cigars. He pressed these things on the two men, lighted
      a cigar himself, and for a long time continued to walk up and down his end
      of the room, smoking and evidently in very deep thought. The visitors left
      him alone, watching him curiously now and then&mdash;until, when quite ten
      minutes had gone by, he suddenly drew a chair close to them and sat down
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, listen to me!" he said. "If I give my confidence to you, as police
      officials, will you give me your word that you won't make use of my
      information until I give you leave&mdash;or until you have consulted me
      further? I shall rely on your word, mind!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say yes to that, doctor," answered Mitchington.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The same here, sir," said the detective.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," continued Ransford. "Then&mdash;this is between ourselves,
      until such time as I say something more about it. First of all, I am not
      going to tell you anything whatever about Braden's antecedents&mdash;at
      present! Secondly&mdash;I am not sure that your theory, Mr. Jettison, is
      entirely correct, though I think it is by way of coming very near to the
      right one&mdash;which is sure to be worked out before long. But&mdash;on
      the understanding of secrecy for the present I can tell you something
      which I should not have been able to tell you but for the events of
      tonight, which have made me put together certain facts. Now attention! To
      begin with, I know where Braden was for at any rate some time on the
      evening of the day on which he came to Wrychester. He was with the old man
      whom we all know as Simpson Harker."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington whistled; the detective, who knew nothing of Simpson Harker,
      glanced at him as if for information. But Mitchington nodded at Ransford,
      and Ransford went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know this for this reason," he continued. "You know where Harker lives.
      I was in attendance for nearly two hours that evening on a patient in a
      house opposite&mdash;I spent a good deal of time in looking out of the
      window. I saw Harker take a man into his house: I saw the man leave the
      house nearly an hour later: I recognized that man next day as the man who
      met his death at the Cathedral. So much for that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good!" muttered Mitchington. "Good! Explains a lot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," continued Ransford, "what I have to tell you now is of a much more
      serious&mdash;and confidential&mdash;nature. Now, do you know&mdash;but,
      of course, you don't!&mdash;that your proceedings tonight were watched?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Watched!" exclaimed Mitchington. "Who watched us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Harker, for one," answered Ransford. "And&mdash;for another&mdash;my late
      assistant, Mr. Pemberton Bryce."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington's jaw dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God bless my soul!" he said. "You don't mean it, doctor! Why, how did you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a minute," interrupted Ransford. He left the room, and the two
      callers looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This chap knows more than you think," observed Jettison in a whisper.
      "More than he's telling now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's get all we can, then," said Mitchington, who was obviously much
      surprised by Ransford's last information. "Get it while he's in the mood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let him take his own time," advised Jettison. "But&mdash;you mark me!&mdash;he
      knows a lot! This is only an instalment."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford came back&mdash;with Dick Bewery, clad in a loud patterned and
      gaily coloured suit of pyjamas.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Dick," said Ransford. "Tell Inspector Mitchington precisely what
      happened this evening, within your own knowledge."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick was nothing loth to tell his story for the second time&mdash;especially
      to a couple of professional listeners. And he told it in full detail, from
      the moment of his sudden encounter with Bryce to that in which he parted
      with Bryce and Harker. Ransford, watching the official faces, saw what it
      was in the story that caught the official attention and excited the
      official mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Bryce went off at once to fetch Harker, did he?" asked Mitchington,
      when Dick had made a end.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At once," answered Dick. "And was jolly quick back with him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Harker said it didn't matter about your telling as it would be public
      news soon enough?" continued Mitchington.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just that," said Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington looked at Ransford, and Ransford nodded to his ward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, Dick," he said. "That'll do."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy went off again, and Mitchington shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Queer!" he said. "Now what have those two been up to?&mdash;something,
      that's certain. Can you tell us more, doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Under the same conditions&mdash;yes," answered Ransford, taking his seat
      again. "The fact is, affairs have got to a stage where I consider it my
      duty to tell you more. Some of what I shall tell you is hearsay&mdash;but
      it's hearsay that you can easily verify for yourselves when the right
      moment comes. Mr. Campany, the librarian, lately remarked to me that my
      old assistant, Mr. Bryce, seemed to be taking an extraordinary interest in
      archaeological matters since he left me&mdash;he was now, said Campany,
      always examining documents about the old tombs and monuments of the
      Cathedral and its precincts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah&mdash;just so!" exclaimed Mitchington. "To be sure!&mdash;I'm
      beginning to see!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And," continued Ransford, "Campany further remarked, as a matter for
      humorous comment, that Bryce was also spending much time looking round our
      old tombs. Now you made this discovery near an old tomb, I understand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Close by one&mdash;yes," assented the inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then let me draw your attention to one or two strange facts&mdash;which
      are undoubted facts," continued Ransford. "Bryce was left alone with the
      dead body of Braden for some minutes, while Varner went to fetch the
      police. That's one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's true," muttered Mitchington. "He was&mdash;several minutes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bryce it was who discovered Collishaw&mdash;in Paradise," said Ransford.
      "That's fact two. And fact three&mdash;Bryce evidently had a motive in
      fetching Harker tonight&mdash;to overlook your operations. What was his
      motive? And taking things altogether; what are, or have been, these secret
      affairs which Bryce and Harker have evidently been engaged in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jettison suddenly rose, buttoning his light overcoat. The action seemed to
      indicate a newly-formed idea, a definite conclusion. He turned sharply to
      Mitchington.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's one thing certain, inspector," he said. "You'll keep an eye on
      those two from this out! From&mdash;just now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall!" assented Mitchington. "I'll have both of 'em shadowed wherever
      they go or are, day or night. Harker, now, has always been a bit of a
      mystery, but Bryce&mdash;hang me if I don't believe he's been having me!
      Double game!&mdash;but, never mind. There's no more, doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not yet," replied Ransford. "And I don't know the real meaning or value
      of what I have told you. But&mdash;in two days from now, I can tell you
      more. In the meantime&mdash;remember your promise!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He let his visitors out then, and went back to Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll not have to wait long for things to clear," he said. "The
      mystery's nearly over!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII. SURPRISE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mitchington and the man from New Scotland Yard walked away in silence from
      Ransford's house and kept the silence up until they were in the middle of
      the Close and accordingly in solitude. Then Mitchington turned to his
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What d'ye think of that?" he asked, with a half laugh. "Different
      complexion it puts on things, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think just what I said before&mdash;in there," replied the detective.
      "That man knows more than he's told, even now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why hasn't he spoken sooner, then?" demanded Mitchington. "He's had two
      good chances&mdash;at the inquests."
    </p>
    <p>
      "From what I saw of him, just now," said Jettison, "I should say he's the
      sort of man who can keep his own counsel till he considers the right time
      has come for speaking. Not the sort of man who'll care twopence whatever's
      said about him, you understand? I should say he's known a good lot all
      along, and is just keeping it back till he can put a finishing touch to
      it. Two days, didn't he say? Aye, well, a lot can happen in two days!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But about your theory?" questioned Mitchington. "What do you think of it
      now&mdash;in relation to what we've just heard?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll tell you what I can see," answered Jettison. "I can see how one bit
      of this puzzle fits into another&mdash;in view of what Ransford has just
      told us. Of course, one's got to do a good deal of supposing it's
      unavoidable in these cases. Now supposing Braden let this man Harker into
      the secret of the hidden jewels that night, and supposing that Harker and
      Bryce are in collusion&mdash;as they evidently are, from what that boy
      told us&mdash;and supposing they between them, together or separately, had
      to do with Braden's death, and supposing that man Collishaw saw some thing
      that would incriminate one or both&mdash;eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" asked Mitchington.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bryce is a medical man," observed Jettison. "It would be an easy thing
      for a medical man to get rid of Collishaw as he undoubtedly was got rid
      of. Do you see my point?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aye&mdash;and I can see that Bryce is a clever hand at throwing dust in
      anybody's eyes!" muttered Mitchington. "I've had some dealings with him
      over this affair and I'm beginning to think&mdash;only now!&mdash;that
      he's been having me for the mug! He's evidently a deep 'un&mdash;and so's
      the other man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wanted to ask you that," said Jettison. "Now, exactly who are these
      two?&mdash;tell me about them&mdash;both."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so much to tell," answered Mitchington. "Harker's a quiet old chap
      who lives in a little house over there&mdash;just off that far corner of
      this Close. Said to be a retired tradesman, from London. Came here a few
      years ago, to settle down. Inoffensive, pleasant old chap. Potters about
      the town&mdash;puts in his time as such old chaps do&mdash;bit of reading
      at the libraries&mdash;bit of gossip here and&mdash;there you know the
      sort. Last man in the world I should have thought would have been mixed up
      in an affair of this sort!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And therefore all the more likely to be!" said Jettison. "Well&mdash;the
      other?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bryce was until the very day of Braden's appearance, Ransford's
      assistant," continued Mitchington. "Been with Ransford about two years.
      Clever chap, undoubtedly, but certainly deep and, in a way, reserved,
      though he can talk plenty if he's so minded and it's to his own advantage.
      He left Ransford suddenly&mdash;that very morning. I don't know why. Since
      then he's remained in the town. I've heard that he's pretty keen on
      Ransford's ward&mdash;sister of that lad we saw tonight. I don't know
      myself, if it's true&mdash;but I've wondered if that had anything to do
      with his leaving Ransford so suddenly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very likely," said Jettison. They had crossed the Close by that time and
      come to a gas-lamp which stood at the entrance, and the detective pulled
      out his watch and glanced at it. "Ten past eleven," he said. "You say you
      know this Bryce pretty well? Now, would it be too late&mdash;if he's up
      still&mdash;to take a look at him! If you and he are on good terms, you
      could make an excuse. After what I've heard, I'd like to get at close
      quarters with this gentleman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Easy enough," assented Mitchington. "I've been there as late as this&mdash;he's
      one of the sort that never goes to bed before midnight. Come on!&mdash;it's
      close by. But&mdash;not a word of where we've been. I'll say I've dropped
      in to give him a bit of news. We'll tell him about the jewel business&mdash;and
      see how he takes it. And while we're there&mdash;size him up!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington was right in his description of Bryce's habits&mdash;Bryce
      rarely went to bed before one o'clock in the morning. He liked to sit up,
      reading. His favourite mental food was found in the lives of statesmen and
      diplomatists, most of them of the sort famous for trickery and chicanery&mdash;he
      not only made a close study of the ways of these gentry but wrote down
      notes and abstracts of passages which particularly appealed to him. His
      lamp was burning when Mitchington and Jettison came in view of his windows&mdash;but
      that night Bryce was doing no thinking about statecraft: his mind was
      fixed on his own affairs. He had lighted his fire on going home and for an
      hour had sat with his legs stretched out on the fender, carefully weighing
      things up. The event of the night had convinced him that he was at a
      critical phase of his present adventure, and it behoved him, as a good
      general, to review his forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      The forestalling of his plans about the hiding-place in Paradise had upset
      Bryce's schemes&mdash;he had figured on being able to turn that secret,
      whatever it was, to his own advantage. It struck him now, as he meditated,
      that he had never known exactly what he expected to get out of that secret&mdash;but
      he had hoped that it would have been something which would make a few more
      considerable and tightly-strung meshes in the net which he was
      endeavouring to weave around Ransford. Now he was faced by the fact that
      it was not going to yield anything in the way of help&mdash;it was a
      secret no longer, and it had yielded nothing beyond the mere knowledge
      that John Braden, who was in reality John Brake, had carried the secret to
      Warchester&mdash;to reveal it in the proper quarter. That helped Bryce in
      no way&mdash;so far as he could see. And therefore it was necessary to
      re-state his case to himself; to take stock; to see where he stood&mdash;and
      more than all, to put plainly before his own mind exactly what he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      And just before Mitchington and the detective came up the path to his
      door, Bryce had put his notions into clear phraseology. His aim was
      definite&mdash;he wanted to get Ransford completely into his power,
      through suspicion of Ransford's guilt in the affairs of Braden and
      Collishaw. He wanted, at the same time, to have the means of exonerating
      him&mdash;whether by fact or by craft&mdash;so that, as an ultimate method
      of success for his own projects he would be able to go to Mary Bewery and
      say "Ransford's very life is at my mercy: if I keep silence, he's lost: if
      I speak, he's saved: it's now for you to say whether I'm to speak or hold
      my tongue&mdash;and you're the price I want for my speaking to save him!"
      It was in accordance with his views of human nature that Mary Bewery would
      accede to his terms: he had not known her and Ransford for nothing, and he
      was aware that she had a profound gratitude for her guardian, which might
      even be akin to a yet unawakened warmer feeling. The probability was that
      she would willingly sacrifice herself to save Ransford&mdash;and Bryce
      cared little by what means he won her, fair or foul, so long as he was
      successful. So now, he said to himself, he must make a still more definite
      move against Ransford. He must strengthen and deepen the suspicions which
      the police already had: he must give them chapter and verse and supply
      them with information, and get Ransford into the tightest of corners,
      solely that, in order to win Mary Bewery, he might have the credit of
      pulling him out again. That, he felt certain, he could do&mdash;if he
      could make a net in which to enclose Ransford he could also invent a
      two-edged sword which would cut every mesh of that net into fragments.
      That would be&mdash;child's play&mdash;mere statecraft&mdash;elementary
      diplomacy. But first&mdash;to get Ransford fairly bottled up&mdash;that
      was the thing! He determined to lose no more time&mdash;and he was
      thinking of visiting Mitchington immediately after breakfast next morning
      when Mitchington knocked at his door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce was rarely taken back, and on seeing Mitchington and a companion, he
      forthwith invited them into his parlour, put out his whisky and cigars,
      and pressed both on them as if their late call were a matter of usual
      occurrence. And when he had helped both to a drink, he took one himself,
      and tumbler in hand, dropped into his easy chair again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We saw your light, doctor&mdash;so I took the liberty of dropping into
      tell you a bit of news," observed the inspector. "But I haven't introduced
      my friend&mdash;this is Detective-Sergeant Jettison, of the Yard&mdash;we've
      got him down about this business&mdash;must have help, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce gave the detective a half-sharp, half-careless look and nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Jettison will have abundant opportunities for the exercise of his
      talents!" he observed in his best cynical manner. "I dare say he's found
      that out already."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not an easy affair, sir, to be sure," assented Jettison. "Complicated!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Highly so!" agreed Bryce. He yawned, and glanced at the inspector.
      "What's your news, Mitchington?" he asked, almost indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well!" answered Mitchington. "As the Herald's published tomorrow
      you'll see it in there, doctor&mdash;I've supplied an account for this
      week's issue; just a short one&mdash;but I thought you'd like to know.
      You've heard of the famous jewel robbery at the Duke's, some years ago?
      Yes?&mdash;well, we've found all the whole bundle tonight&mdash;buried in
      Paradise! And how do you think the secret came out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No good at guessing," said Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It came out," continued Mitchington, "through a man who, with Braden&mdash;Braden,
      mark you!&mdash;got in possession of it&mdash;it's a long story&mdash;and,
      with Braden, was going to reveal it to the Duke that very day Braden was
      killed. This man waited until this very morning and then told his Grace&mdash;his
      Grace came with him to us this afternoon, and tonight we made a search and
      found&mdash;everything! Buried&mdash;there in Paradise! Dug 'em up,
      doctor!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce showed no great interest. He took a leisurely sip at his liquor and
      set down the glass and pulled out his cigarette case. The two men,
      watching him narrowly, saw that his fingers were steady as rocks as he
      struck the match.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he said as he threw the match away. "I saw you busy."
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of himself Mitchington could not repress a start nor a glance at
      Jettison. But Jettison was as imperturbable as Bryce himself, and
      Mitchington raised a forced laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did!" he said, incredulously. "And we thought we had it all to
      ourselves! How did you come to know, doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young Bewery told me what was going on," replied Bryce, "so I took a look
      at you. And I fetched old Harker to take a look, too. We all watched you&mdash;the
      boy, Harker, and I&mdash;out of sheer curiosity, of course. We saw you get
      up the parcel. But, naturally, I didn't know what was in it&mdash;till
      now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington, thoroughly taken aback by this candid statement, was at a
      loss for words, and again he glanced at Jettison. But Jettison gave no
      help, and Mitchington fell back on himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you fetched old Harker?" he said. "What&mdash;what for, doctor? If one
      may ask, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce made a careless gesture with his cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh&mdash;old Harker's deeply interested in what's going on," he answered.
      "And as young Bewery drew my attention to your proceedings, why, I thought
      I'd draw Harker's. And Harker was&mdash;interested."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington hesitated before saying more. But eventually he risked a
      leading question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any special reason why he should be, doctor?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce put his thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat and looked
      half-lazily at his questioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know who old Harker really is?" he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" answered Mitchington. "I know nothing about him&mdash;except that
      he's said to be a retired tradesman, from London, who settled down here
      some time ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce suddenly turned on Jettison.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I, sir!" exclaimed Jettison. "I don't know this gentleman&mdash;at all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce laughed&mdash;with his usual touch of cynical sneering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll tell you&mdash;now&mdash;who old Harker is, Mitchington," he said.
      "You may as well know. I thought Mr. Jettison might recognize the name.
      Harker is no retired London tradesman&mdash;he's a retired member of your
      profession, Mr. Jettison. He was in his day one of the smartest men in the
      service of your department. Only he's transposed his name&mdash;ask them
      at the Yard if they remember Harker Simpson? That seems to startle you,
      Mitchington! Well, as you're here, perhaps I'd better startle you a bit
      more."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX. THE SUBTLETY OF THE DEVIL
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was a sudden determination and alertness in Bryce's last words which
      contrasted strongly, and even strangely, with the almost cynical
      indifference that had characterized him since his visitors came in, and
      the two men recognized it and glanced questioningly at each other. There
      was an alteration, too, in his manner; instead of lounging lazily in his
      chair, as if he had no other thought than of personal ease, he was now
      sitting erect, looking sharply from one man to the other; his whole
      attitude, bearing, speech seemed to indicate that he had suddenly made up
      his mind to adopt some definite course of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll tell you more!" he repeated. "And, since you're here&mdash;now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington, who felt a curious uneasiness, gave Jettison another glance.
      And this time it was Jettison who spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should say," he remarked quietly, "knowing what I've gathered of the
      matter, that we ought to be glad of any information Dr. Bryce can give
      us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, to be sure!" assented Mitchington. "You know more, then, doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce motioned his visitors to draw their chairs nearer to his, and when
      he spoke it was in the low, concentrated tones of a man who means business&mdash;and
      confidential business.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now look here, Mitchington," he said, "and you, too, Mr. Jettison, as
      you're on this job&mdash;I'm going to talk straight to both of you. And to
      begin with, I'll make a bold assertion&mdash;I know more of this
      Wrychester Paradise mystery&mdash;involving the deaths of both Braden and
      Collishaw, than any man living&mdash;because, though you don't know it,
      Mitchington, I've gone right into it. And I'll tell you in confidence why
      I went into it&mdash;I want to marry Dr. Ransford's ward, Miss Bewery!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce accompanied this candid admission with a look which seemed to say:
      Here we are, three men of the world, who know what things are&mdash;we
      understand each other! And while Jettison merely nodded comprehendingly,
      Mitchington put his thoughts into words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure, doctor, to be sure!" he said. "And accordingly&mdash;what's
      their affair, is yours! Of course!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something like that," assented Bryce. "Naturally no man wishes to marry
      unless he knows as much as he can get to know about the woman he wants,
      her family, her antecedents&mdash;and all that. Now, pretty nearly
      everybody in Wrychester who knows them, knows that there's a mystery about
      Dr. Ransford and his two wards&mdash;it's been talked of, no end, amongst
      the old dowagers and gossips of the Close, particularly&mdash;you know
      what they are! Miss Bewery herself, and her brother, young Dick, in a
      lesser degree, know there's a mystery. And if there's one man in the world
      who knows the secret, it's Ransford. And, up to now, Ransford won't tell&mdash;he
      won't even tell Miss Bewery. I know that she's asked him&mdash;he keeps up
      an obstinate silence. And so&mdash;I determined to find things out for
      myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aye&mdash;and when did you start on that little game, now, doctor?" asked
      Mitchington. "Was it before, or since, this affair developed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a really serious way&mdash;since," replied Bryce. "What happened on
      the day of Braden's death made me go thoroughly into the whole matter.
      Now, what did happen? I'll tell you frankly, now, Mitchington, that when
      we talked once before about this affair, I didn't tell you all I might
      have told. I'd my reasons for reticence. But now I'll give you full
      particulars of what happened that morning within my knowledge&mdash;pay
      attention, both of you, and you'll see how one thing fits into another.
      That morning, about half-past nine, Ransford left his surgery and went
      across the Close. Not long after he'd gone, this man Braden came to the
      door, and asked me if Dr. Ransford was in? I said he wasn't&mdash;he'd
      just gone out, and I showed the man in which direction. He said he'd once
      known a Dr. Ransford, and went away. A little later, I followed. Near the
      entrance of Paradise, I saw Ransford leaving the west porch of the
      Cathedral. He was undeniably in a state of agitation&mdash;pale, nervous.
      He didn't see me. I went on and met Varner, who told me of the accident. I
      went with him to the foot of St. Wrytha's Stair and found the man who had
      recently called at the surgery. He died just as I reached him. I sent for
      you. When you came, I went back to the surgery&mdash;I found Ransford
      there in a state of most unusual agitation&mdash;he looked like a man who
      has had a terrible shock. So much for these events. Put them together."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce paused awhile, as if marshalling his facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, after that," he continued presently, "I began to investigate matters
      myself&mdash;for my own satisfaction. And very soon I found out certain
      things&mdash;which I'll summarize, briefly, because some of my facts are
      doubtless known to you already. First of all&mdash;the man who came here
      as John Braden was, in reality, one John Brake. He was at one time manager
      of a branch of a well-known London banking company. He appropriated money
      from them under apparently mysterious circumstances of which I, as yet,
      knew nothing; he was prosecuted, convicted, and sentenced to ten years'
      penal servitude. And those two wards of Ransford's, Mary and Richard
      Bewery, as they are called, are, in reality, Mary and Richard Brake&mdash;his
      children."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've established that as a fact?" asked Jettison, who was listening
      with close attention. "It's not a surmise on your part?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce hesitated before replying to this question. After all, he reflected,
      it was a surmise. He could not positively prove his assertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he answered after a moment's thought, "I'll qualify that by saying
      that from the evidence I have, and from what I know, I believe it to be an
      indisputable fact. What I do know of fact, hard, positive fact, is this:&mdash;John
      Brake married a Mary Bewery at the parish church of Braden Medworth, near
      Barthorpe, in Leicestershire: I've seen the entry in the register with my
      own eyes. His best man, who signed the register as a witness, was Mark
      Ransford. Brake and Ransford, as young men, had been in the habit of going
      to Braden Medworth to fish; Mary Bewery was governess at the vicarage
      there. It was always supposed she would marry Ransford; instead, she
      married Brake, who, of course, took her off to London. Of their married
      life, I know nothing. But within a few years, Brake was in trouble, for
      the reason I have told you. He was arrested&mdash;and Harker was the man
      who arrested him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me!" exclaimed Mitchington. "Now, if I'd only known&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll know a lot before I'm through," said Bryce. "Now, Harker, of
      course, can tell a lot&mdash;yet it's unsatisfying. Brake could make no
      defence&mdash;but his counsel threw out strange hints and suggestions&mdash;all
      to the effect that Brake had been cruelly and wickedly deceived&mdash;in
      fact, as it were, trapped into doing what he did. And&mdash;by a man whom
      he'd trusted as a close friend. So much came to Harker's ears&mdash;but no
      more, and on that particular point I've no light. Go on from that to
      Brake's private affairs. At the time of his arrest he had a wife and two
      very young children. Either just before, or at, or immediately after his
      arrest they completely disappeared&mdash;and Brake himself utterly refused
      to say one single word about them. Harker asked if he could do anything&mdash;Brake's
      answer was that no one was to concern himself. He preserved an obstinate
      silence on that point. The clergyman in whose family Mrs. Brake had been
      governess saw Brake, after his conviction&mdash;Brake would say nothing to
      him. Of Mrs. Brake, nothing more is known&mdash;to me at any rate. What
      was known at the time is this&mdash;Brake communicated to all who came in
      contact with him, just then, the idea of a man who has been cruelly
      wronged and deceived, who takes refuge in sullen silence, and who is
      already planning and cherishing&mdash;revenge!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aye, aye!" muttered Mitchington. "Revenge?&mdash;just So!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Brake, then," continued Bryce, "goes off to his term of penal servitude,
      and so disappears&mdash;until he reappears here in Wrychester. Leave him
      for a moment, and go back. And&mdash;it's a going back, no doubt, to
      supposition and to theory&mdash;but there's reason in what I shall
      advance. We know&mdash;beyond doubt&mdash;that Brake had been tricked and
      deceived, in some money matter, by some man&mdash;some mysterious man&mdash;whom
      he referred to as having been his closest friend. We know, too, that there
      was extraordinary mystery in the disappearance of his wife and children.
      Now, from all that has been found out, who was Brake's closest friend?
      Ransford! And of Ransford, at that time, there's no trace. He, too,
      disappeared&mdash;that's a fact which I've established. Years later, he
      reappears&mdash;here at Wrychester, where he's bought a practice.
      Eventually he has two young people, who are represented as his wards, come
      to live with him. Their name is Bewery. The name of the young woman whom
      John Brake married was Bewery. What's the inference? That their mother's
      dead&mdash;that they're known under her maiden name: that they, without a
      shadow of doubt, are John Brake's children. And that leads up to my theory&mdash;which
      I'll now tell you in confidence&mdash;if you wish for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's what I particularly wish for," observed Jettison quietly. "The very
      thing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, it's this," said Bryce. "Ransford was the close friend who tricked
      and deceived Brake:
    </p>
    <p>
      "He probably tricked him in some money affair, and deceived him in his
      domestic affairs. I take it that Ransford ran away with Brake's wife, and
      that Brake, sooner than air all his grievance to the world, took it
      silently and began to concoct his ideas of revenge. I put the whole thing
      this way. Ransford ran away with Mrs. Brake and the two children&mdash;mere
      infants&mdash;and disappeared. Brake, when he came out of prison, went
      abroad&mdash;possibly with the idea of tracking them. Meanwhile, as is
      quite evident, he engaged in business and did well. He came back to
      England as John Braden, and, for the reason of which you're aware, he paid
      a visit to Wrychester, utterly unaware that any one known to him lived
      here. Now, try to reconstruct what happened. He looks round the Close that
      morning. He sees the name of Dr. Mark Ransford on the brass plate of a
      surgery door. He goes to the surgery, asks a question, makes a remark,
      goes away. What is the probable sequence of events? He meets Ransford near
      the Cathedral&mdash;where Ransford certainly was. They recognize each
      other&mdash;most likely they turn aside, go up to that gallery as a quiet
      place, to talk&mdash;there is an altercation&mdash;blows&mdash;somehow or
      other, probably from accident, Braden is thrown through that open doorway,
      to his death. And&mdash;Collishaw saw what happened!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce was watching his listeners, turning alternately from one to the
      other. But it needed little attention on his part to see that theirs was
      already closely strained; each man was eagerly taking in all that he said
      and suggested. And he went on emphasizing every point as he made it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Collishaw saw what happened?" he repeated. "That, of course, is theory&mdash;supposition.
      But now we pass from theory back to actual fact. I'll tell you something
      now, Mitchington, which you've never heard of, I'm certain. I made it in
      my way, after Collishaw's death, to get some information, secretly, from
      his widow, who's a fairly shrewd, intelligent woman for her class. Now,
      the widow, in looking over her husband's effects, in a certain drawer in
      which he kept various personal matters, came across the deposit book of a
      Friendly Society of which Collishaw had been a member for some years. It
      appears that he, Collishaw, was something of a saving man, and every year
      he managed to put by a bit of money out of his wages, and twice or thrice
      in the year he took these savings&mdash;never very much; merely a pound or
      two&mdash;to this Friendly Society, which, it seems, takes deposits in
      that way from its members. Now, in this book is an entry&mdash;I saw it&mdash;which
      shows that only two days before his death, Collishaw paid fifty pounds&mdash;fifty
      pounds, mark you!&mdash;into the Friendly Society. Where should Collishaw
      get fifty pounds, all of a sudden! He was a mason's labourer, earning at
      the very outside twenty-six or eight shillings a week. According to his
      wife, there was no one to leave him a legacy. She never heard of his
      receipt of this money from any source. But&mdash;there's the fact! What
      explains it? My theory&mdash;that the rumour that Collishaw, with a pint
      too much ale in him, had hinted that he could say something about Braden's
      death if he chose, had reached Braden's assailant; that he had made it his
      business to see Collishaw and had paid him that fifty pounds as hush-money&mdash;and,
      later, had decided to rid himself of Collishaw altogether, as he
      undoubtedly did, by poison."
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more Bryce paused&mdash;and once more the two listeners showed their
      attention by complete silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now we come to the question&mdash;how was Collishaw poisoned?" continued
      Bryce. "For poisoned he was, without doubt. Here we go back to theory and
      supposition once more. I haven't the least doubt that the hydrocyanic acid
      which caused his death was taken by him in a pill&mdash;a pill that was in
      that box which they found on him, Mitchington, and showed me. But that
      particular pill, though precisely similar in appearance, could not be made
      up of the same ingredients which were in the other pills. It was probably
      a thickly coated pill which contained the poison;&mdash;in solution of
      course. The coating would melt almost as soon as the man had swallowed it&mdash;and
      death would result instantaneously. Collishaw, you may say, was condemned
      to death when he put that box of pills in his waistcoat pocket. It was
      mere chance, mere luck, as to when the exact moment of death came to him.
      There had been six pills in that box&mdash;there were five left. So
      Collishaw picked out the poisoned pill&mdash;first! It might have been
      delayed till the sixth dose, you see&mdash;but he was doomed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington showed a desire to speak, and Bryce paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about what Ransford said before the Coroner?" asked Mitchington. "He
      demanded certain information about the post-mortem, you know, which, he
      said, ought to have shown that there was nothing poisonous in those
      pills."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pooh!" exclaimed Bryce contemptuously. "Mere bluff! Of such a pill as
      that I've described there'd be no trace but the sugar coating&mdash;and
      the poison. I tell you, I haven't the least doubt that that was how the
      poison was administered. It was easy. And&mdash;who is there that would
      know how easily it could be administered but&mdash;a medical man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington and Jettison exchanged glances. Then Jettison leaned nearer to
      Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So your theory is that Ransford got rid of both Braden and Collishaw&mdash;murdered
      both of them, in fact?" he suggested. "Do I understand that's what it
      really comes to&mdash;in plain words?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not quite," replied Bryce. "I don't say that Ransford meant to kill
      Braden&mdash;my notion is that they met, had an altercation, probably a
      struggle, and that Braden lost his life in it. But as regards Collishaw&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't forget!" interrupted Mitchington. "Varner swore that he saw Braden
      flung through that doorway! Flung out! He saw a hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For everything that Varner could prove to the contrary," answered Bryce,
      "the hand might have been stretched out to pull Braden back. No&mdash;I
      think there may have been accident in that affair. But, as regards
      Collishaw&mdash;murder, without doubt&mdash;deliberate!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He lighted another cigarette, with the air of a man who had spoken his
      mind, and Mitchington, realizing that he had said all he had to say, got
      up from his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;it's all very interesting and very clever, doctor," he said,
      glancing at Jettison. "And we shall keep it all in mind. Of course, you've
      talked all this over with Harker? I should like to know what he has to
      say. Now that you've told us who he is, I suppose we can talk to him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll have to wait a few days, then," said Bryce. "He's gone to town&mdash;by
      the last train tonight&mdash;on this business. I've sent him. I had some
      information today about Ransford's whereabouts during the time of
      disappearance, and I've commissioned Harker to examine into it. When I
      hear what he's found out, I'll let you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're taking some trouble," remarked Mitchington.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've told you the reason," answered Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington hesitated a little; then, with a motion of his head towards
      the door, beckoned Jettison to follow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," he said. "There's plenty for us to see into, I'm thinking!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce laughed and pointed to a shelf of books near the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know what Napoleon Bonaparte once gave as sound advice to police?"
      he asked. "No! Then I'll tell you. 'The art of the police,' he said, 'is
      not to see that which it is useless for it to see.' Good counsel,
      Mitchington!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men went away through the midnight streets, and kept silence until
      they were near the door of Jettison's hotel. Then Mitchington spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!" he said. "We've had a couple of tales, anyhow! What do you think
      of things, now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jettison threw back his head with a dry laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never been better puzzled in all my time!" he said. "Never! But&mdash;if
      that young doctor's playing a game&mdash;then, by the Lord Harry,
      inspector, it's a damned deep 'un! And my advice is&mdash;watch the lot!"

      CHAPTER XX. JETTISON TAKES A HAND
    </h2>
    <p>
      By breakfast time next morning the man from New Scotland Yard had
      accomplished a series of meditations on the confidences made to him and
      Mitchington the night before and had determined on at least one course of
      action. But before entering upon it he had one or two important letters to
      write, the composition of which required much thought and trouble, and by
      the time he had finished them, and deposited them by his own hand in the
      General Post Office, it was drawing near to noon&mdash;the great bell of
      the Cathedral, indeed, was proclaiming noontide to Wrychester as Jettison
      turned into the police-station and sought Mitchington in his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was just coming round to see if you'd overslept yourself," said
      Mitchington good-humouredly. "We were up pretty late last night, or,
      rather, this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've had letters to write," said Jettison. He sat down and picked up a
      newspaper and cast a casual glance over it. "Got anything fresh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, this much," answered Mitchington. "The two gentlemen who told us so
      much last night are both out of town. I made an excuse to call on them
      both early this morning&mdash;just on nine o'clock. Dr. Ransford went up
      to London by the eight-fifteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Bryce, says his landlady, went out on his bicycle at half-past eight&mdash;where,
      she didn't know, but, she fancied, into the country. However, I
      ascertained that Ransford is expected back this evening, and Bryce gave
      orders for his usual dinner to be ready at seven o'clock, and so&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jettison flung away the newspaper and pulled out his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I don't think they'll run away&mdash;either of 'em," he remarked
      indifferently. "They're both too cock-sure of their own ways of looking at
      things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You looked at 'em any more?" asked Mitchington.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Done a bit of reflecting&mdash;yes," replied the detective. "Complicated
      affair, my lad! More in it than one would think at first sight. I'm
      certain of this quite apart from whatever mystery there is about the
      Braden affair and the Collishaw murder, there's a lot of scheming and
      contriving been going on&mdash;and is going on!&mdash;somewhere, by
      somebody. Underhand work, you understand? However, my particular job is
      the Collishaw business&mdash;and there's a bit of information I'd like to
      get hold of at once. Where's the office of that Friendly Society we heard
      about last night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That'll be the Wrychester Second Friendly," answered Mitchington. "There
      are two such societies in the town&mdash;the first's patronized by small
      tradesmen and the like; the second by workingmen. The second does take
      deposits from its members. The office is in Fladgate&mdash;secretary's
      name outside&mdash;Mr. Stebbing. What are you after?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell you later," said Jettison. "Just an idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went leisurely out and across the market square and into the narrow,
      old-world street called Fladgate, along which he strolled as if doing no
      more than looking about him until he came to an ancient shop which had
      been converted into an office, and had a wire blind over the lower half of
      its front window, wherein was woven in conspicuous gilt letters Wrychester
      Second Friendly Society&mdash;George Stebbing, Secretary. Nothing
      betokened romance or mystery in that essentially humble place, but it was
      in Jettison's mind that when he crossed its threshold he was on his way to
      discovering something that would possibly clear up the problem on which he
      was engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The staff of the Second Friendly was inconsiderable in numbers&mdash;an
      outer office harboured a small boy and a tall young man; an inner one
      accommodated Mr. Stebbing, also a young man, sandy-haired and freckled,
      who, having inspected Detective-Sergeant Jettison's professional card,
      gave him the best chair in the room and stared at him with a mingling of
      awe and curiosity which plainly showed that he had never entertained a
      detective before. And as if to show his visitor that he realized the
      seriousness of the occasion, he nodded meaningly at his door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All safe, here, sir!" he whispered. "Well fitting doors in these old
      houses&mdash;knew how to make 'em in those days. No chance of being
      overheard here&mdash;what can I do for you, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you&mdash;much obliged to you," said Jettison. "No objection to my
      pipe, I suppose? Just so. Ah!&mdash;well, between you and me, Mr.
      Stebbing, I'm down here in connection with that Collishaw case&mdash;you
      know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know, sir&mdash;poor fellow!" said the secretary. "Cruel thing, sir, if
      the man was put an end to. One of our members, was Collishaw, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I understand," remarked Jettison. "That's what I've come about. Bit of
      information, on the quiet, eh? Strictly between our two selves&mdash;for
      the present."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stebbing nodded and winked, as if he had been doing business with
      detectives all his life. "To be sure, sir, to be sure!" he responded with
      alacrity. "Just between you and me and the door post!&mdash;all right. Anything
      I can do, Mr. Jettison, shall be done. But it's more in the way of what I
      can tell, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something of that sort," replied Jettison in his slow, easy-going
      fashion. "I want to know a thing or two. Yours is a working-man's society,
      I think? Aye&mdash;and I understand you've a system whereby such a man can
      put his bits of savings by in your hands?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A capital system, too!" answered the secretary, seizing on a pamphlet and
      pushing it into his visitor's hand. "I don't believe there's better in
      England! If you read that&mdash;"
    </p>
<p>
"I'll take a look at it some time," said Jettison, putting the pamphlet
in his pocket. "Well, now, I also understand that Collishaw was in the
habit of bringing you a bit of saved money now and then a sort of saving
fellow, wasn't he?" Stebbing nodded assent and reached for a ledger
which lay on the farther side of his desk.
</p>
<p>
"Collishaw," he answered, "had been a member  of our society
ever since it started&mdash;fourteen years ago. And he'd been putting in
savings for some eight or nine years. Not much, you'll understand. Say,
as an average, two to three pounds every half-year&mdash;never more. But,
just before his death, or murder, or whatever you like to call it, he
came in here one day with fifty pounds! Fairly astounded me, sir! Fifty
pounds&mdash;all in a lump!"
</p>
    <p>
      "It's about that fifty pounds I want to know something," said Jettison.
      "He didn't tell you how he'd come by it? Wasn't a legacy, for instance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He didn't say anything but that he'd had a bit of luck," answered
      Stebbing. "I asked no questions. Legacy, now?&mdash;no, he didn't mention
      that. Here it is," he continued, turning over the pages of the ledger.
      "There! 50 pounds. You see the date&mdash;that 'ud be two days before his
      death."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jettison glanced at the ledger and resumed his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, then, Mr. Stebbing, I want you to tell me something very definite,"
      he said. "It's not so long since this happened, so you'll not have to tag
      your memory to any great extent. In what form did Collishaw pay that fifty
      pounds to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's easy answered, sir," said the secretary. "It was in gold. Fifty
      sovereigns&mdash;he had 'em in a bit of a bag." Jettison reflected on this
      information for a moment or two. Then he rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much obliged to you, Mr. Stebbing," he said. "That's something worth
      knowing. Now there's something else you can tell me as long as I'm here&mdash;though,
      to be sure, I could save you the trouble by using my own eyes. How many
      banks are there in this little city of yours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three," answered Stebbing promptly. "Old Bank, in Monday Market; Popham
      &amp; Hargreaves, in the Square; Wrychester Bank, in Spurriergate. That's
      the lot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much obliged," said Jettison. "And&mdash;for the present&mdash;not a word
      of what we've talked about. You'll be hearing more&mdash;later."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went away, memorizing the names of the three banking establishments&mdash;ten
      minutes later he was in the private parlour of the first, in serious
      conversation with its manager. Here it was necessary to be more secret,
      and to insist on more secrecy than with the secretary of the Second
      Friendly, and to produce all his credentials and give all his reasons. But
      Jettison drew that covert blank, and the next, too, and it was not until
      he had been closeted for some time with the authorities of the third bank
      that he got the information he wanted. And when he had got it, he
      impressed secrecy and silence on his informants in a fashion which showed
      them that however easy-going his manner might be, he knew his business as
      thoroughly as they knew theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was by that time past one o'clock, and Jettison turned into the small
      hotel at which he had lodged himself. He thought much and gravely while he
      ate his dinner; he thought still more while he smoked his after-dinner
      pipe. And his face was still heavy with thought when, at three o'clock, he
      walked into Mitchington's office and finding the inspector alone shut the
      door and drew a chair to Mitchington's desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now then," he said. "I've had a rare morning's work, and made a
      discovery, and you and me, my lad, have got to have about as serious a bit
      of talk as we've had since I came here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington pushed his papers aside and showed his keen attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You remember what that young fellow told us last night about that man
      Collishaw paying in fifty pounds to the Second Friendly two days before
      his death," said Jettison. "Well, I thought over that business a lot,
      early this morning, and I fancied I saw how I could find something out
      about it. So I have&mdash;on the strict quiet. That's why I went to the
      Friendly Society. The fact was&mdash;I wanted to know in what form
      Collishaw handed in that fifty pounds. I got to know. Gold!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington, whose work hitherto had not led him into the mysteries of
      detective enterprise, nodded delightedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good!" he said. "Rare idea! I should never have thought of it! And&mdash;what
      do you make out of that, now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing," replied Jettison. "But&mdash;a good deal out of what I've
      learned since that bit of a discovery. Now, put it to yourself&mdash;whoever
      it was that paid Collishaw that fifty pounds in gold did it with a motive.
      More than one motive, to be exact&mdash;but we'll stick to one, to begin
      with. The motive for paying in gold was&mdash;avoidance of discovery. A
      cheque can be readily traced. So can banknotes. But gold is not easily
      traced. Therefore the man who paid Collishaw fifty pounds took care to
      provide himself with gold. Now then&mdash;how many men are there in a
      small place like this who are likely to carry fifty pounds in gold in
      their pockets, or to have it at hand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not many," agreed Mitchington.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so&mdash;and therefore I've been doing a bit of secret inquiry
      amongst the bankers, as to who supplied himself with gold about that
      date," continued Jettison. "I'd to convince 'em of the absolute necessity
      of information, too, before I got any! But I got some&mdash;at the third
      attempt. On the day previous to that on which Collishaw handed that fifty
      pounds to Stebbing, a certain Wrychester man drew fifty pounds in gold at
      his bank. Who do you think he was?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who&mdash;who?" demanded Mitchington.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jettison leaned half-across the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bryce!" he said in a whisper. "Bryce!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington sat up in his chair and opened his mouth in sheer
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good heavens!" he muttered after a moment's silence. "You don't mean it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fact!" answered Jettison. "Plain, incontestable fact, my lad. Dr. Bryce
      keeps an account at the Wrychester bank. On the day I'm speaking of he
      cashed a cheque to self for fifty pounds and took it all in gold."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men looked at each other as if each were asking his companion a
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" said Mitchington at last. "You're a cut above me, Jettison. What
      do you make of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said last night that the young man was playing a deep game," replied
      Jettison. "But&mdash;what game? What's he building up? For mark you,
      Mitchington, if&mdash;I say if, mind!&mdash;if that fifty pounds which he
      drew in gold is the identical fifty paid to Collishaw, Bryce didn't pay it
      as hush-money!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think not?" said Mitchington, evidently surprised. "Now, that was my
      first impression. If it wasn't hush-money&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It wasn't hush-money, for this reason," interrupted Jettison. "We know
      that whatever else he knew, Bryce didn't know of the accident to Braden
      until Varner fetched him to Braden. That's established&mdash;on what
      you've put before me. Therefore, whatever Collishaw saw, before or at the
      time that accident happened, it wasn't Bryce who was mixed up in it.
      Therefore, why should Bryce pay Collishaw hush-money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington, who had evidently been thinking, suddenly pulled out a drawer
      in his desk and took some papers from it which he began to turn over.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a minute," he said. "I've an abstract here&mdash;of what the foreman
      at the Cathedral mason's yard told me of what he knew as to where
      Collishaw was working that morning when the accident happened&mdash;I made
      a note of it when I questioned him after Collishaw's death. Here you are:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  'Foreman says that on morning of Braden's accident,
   Collishaw was at work in the north gallery of the
   clerestory, clearing away some timber which the
   carpenters had left there.  Collishaw was certainly
   thus engaged from nine o'clock until past eleven
   that morning.  Mem.  Have investigated this myself.
   From the exact spot where C. was clearing the timber,
   there is an uninterrupted view of the gallery on the
   south side of the nave, and of the arched doorway at
   the head of St.  Wrytha's Stair.'"
</pre>
    <p>
      "'Well," observed Jettison, "that proves what I'm saying. It wasn't
      hush-money. For whoever it was that Collishaw saw lay hands on Braden, it
      wasn't Bryce&mdash;Bryce, we know, was at that time coming across the
      Close or crossing that path through the part you call Paradise: Varner's
      evidence proves that. So&mdash;if the fifty pounds wasn't paid for
      hush-money, what was it paid for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you suggest anything?" asked Mitchington.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've thought of two or three things," answered the detective. "One's this&mdash;was
      the fifty pounds paid for information? If so, and Bryce has that
      information, why doesn't he show his hand more plainly? If he bribed
      Collishaw with fifty pounds: to tell him who Braden's assailant was, he
      now knows!&mdash;so why doesn't he let it out, and have done with it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Part of his game&mdash;if that theory's right," murmured Mitchington.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It mayn't be right," said Jettison. "But it's one. And there's another&mdash;supposing
      he paid Collishaw that money on behalf of somebody else? I've thought this
      business out right and left, top-side and bottom-side, and hang me if I
      don't feel certain there is somebody else! What did Ransford tell us about
      Bryce and this old Harker&mdash;think of that! And yet, according to
      Bryce, Harker is one of our old Yard men!&mdash;and therefore ought to be
      above suspicion."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington suddenly started as if an idea had occurred to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, you know!" he exclaimed. "We've only Bryce's word for it that
      Harker is an ex-detective. I never heard that he was&mdash;if he is, he's
      kept it strangely quiet. You'd have thought that he'd have let us know,
      here, of his previous calling&mdash;I never heard of a policeman of any
      rank who didn't like to have a bit of talk with his own sort about
      professional matters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor me," assented Jettison. "And as you say, we've only Bryce's word.
      And, the more I think of it, the more I'm convinced there's somebody&mdash;some
      man of whom you don't seem to have the least idea&mdash;who's in this. And
      it may be that Bryce is in with him. However&mdash;here's one thing I'm
      going to do at once. Bryce gave us that information about the fifty
      pounds. Now I'm going to tell Bryce straight out that I've gone into that
      matter in my own fashion&mdash;a fashion he evidently never thought of&mdash;and
      ask him to explain why he drew a similar amount in gold. Come on round to
      his rooms."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Bryce was not to be found at his rooms&mdash;had not been back to his
      rooms, said his landlady, since he had ridden away early in the morning:
      all she knew was that he had ordered his dinner to be ready at his usual
      time that evening. With that the two men had to be content, and they went
      back to the police-station still discussing the situation. And they were
      still discussing it an hour later when a telegram was handed to
      Mitchington, who tore it open, glanced over its contents and passed it to
      his companion who read it aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Meet me with Jettison Wrychester Station on arrival of five-twenty
      express from London mystery cleared up guilty men known&mdash;Ransford."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jettison handed the telegram back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man of his word!" he said. "He mentioned two days&mdash;he's done it in
      one! And now, my lad&mdash;do you notice?&mdash;he says men, not man! It's
      as I said&mdash;there's been more than one of 'em in this affair. Now then&mdash;who
      are they?"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. THE SAXONSTEADE ARMS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Bryce had ridden away on his bicycle from Wrychester that morning intent
      on a new piece of diplomacy. He had sat up thinking for some time after
      the two police officials had left him at midnight, and it had occurred to
      him that there was a man from whom information could be had of whose
      services he had as yet made no use but who must be somewhere in the
      neighbourhood&mdash;the man Glassdale. Glassdale had been in Wrychester
      the previous evening; he could scarcely be far away now; there was
      certainly one person who would know where he could be found, and that
      person was the Duke of Saxonsteade. Bryce knew the Duke to be an extremely
      approachable man, a talkative, even a garrulous man, given to holding
      converse with anybody about anything, and he speedily made up his mind to
      ride over to Saxonsteade, invent a plausible excuse for his call, and get
      some news out of his Grace. Even if Glassdale had left the neighbourhood,
      there might be fragments of evidence to pick up from the Duke, for
      Glassdale, he knew, had given his former employer the information about
      the stolen jewels and would, no doubt, have added more about his
      acquaintance with Braden. And before Bryce came to his dreamed-of
      master-stroke in that matter, there were one or two things he wanted to
      clear up, to complete his double net, and he had an idea that an hour's
      chat with Glassdale would yield all that he desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The active brain that had stood Bryce in good stead while he spun his
      meshes and devised his schemes was more active than ever that early summer
      morning. It was a ten-mile ride through woods and valleys to Saxonsteade,
      and there were sights and beauties of nature on either side of him which
      any other man would have lingered to admire and most men would have been
      influenced by. But Bryce had no eyes for the clouds over the
      copper-crowned hills or the mystic shadows in the deep valleys or the new
      buds in the hedgerows, and no thought for the rustic folk whose cottages
      he passed here and there in a sparsely populated country. All his thoughts
      were fixed on his schemes, almost as mechanically as his eyes followed the
      white road in front of his wheel. Ever since he had set out on his
      campaign he had regularly taken stock of his position; he was for ever
      reckoning it up. And now, in his opinion, everything looked very
      promising. He had&mdash;so far as he was aware&mdash;created a definite
      atmosphere of suspicion around and against Ransford&mdash;it needed only a
      little more suggestion, perhaps a little more evidence to bring about
      Ransford's arrest. And the only question which at all troubled Bryce was&mdash;should
      he let matters go to that length before putting his ultimatum before Mary
      Bewery, or should he show her his hand first? For Bryce had so worked
      matters that a word from him to the police would damn Ransford or save him&mdash;and
      now it all depended, so far as Bryce himself was concerned, on Mary Bewery
      as to which word should be said. Elaborate as the toils were which he had
      laid out for Ransford to the police, he could sweep them up and tear them
      away with a sentence of added knowledge&mdash;if Mary Bewery made it worth
      his while. But first&mdash;before coming to the critical point&mdash;there
      was yet certain information which he desired to get, and he felt sure of
      getting it if he could find Glassdale. For Glassdale, according to all
      accounts, had known Braden intimately of late years, and was most likely
      in possession of facts about him&mdash;and Bryce had full confidence in
      himself as an interviewer of other men and a supreme belief that he could
      wheedle a secret out of anybody with whom he could procure an hour's quiet
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As luck would have it, Bryce had no need to make a call upon the
      approachable and friendly Duke. Outside the little village at Saxonsteade,
      on the edge of the deep woods which fringed the ducal park, stood an old
      wayside inn, a relic of the coaching days, which bore on its sign the
      ducal arms. Into its old stone hall marched Bryce to refresh himself after
      his ride, and as he stood at the bow-windowed bar, he glanced into the
      garden beyond and there saw, comfortably smoking his pipe and reading the
      newspaper, the very man he was looking for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce had no spice of bashfulness, no want of confidence anywhere in his
      nature; he determined to attack Glassdale there and then. But he took a
      good look at his man before going out into the garden to him. A plain and
      ordinary sort of fellow, he thought; rather over middle age, with a tinge
      of grey in his hair and moustache; prosperous looking and well-dressed,
      and at that moment of the appearance of what he was probably taken for by
      the inn people&mdash;a tourist. Whether he was the sort who would be
      communicative or not, Bryce could not tell from outward signs, but he was
      going to try, and he presently found his card-case, took out a card, and
      strolling down the garden to the shady spot in which Glassdale sat,
      assumed his politest and suavest manner and presented himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Allow me, sir," he said, carefully abstaining from any mention of names.
      "May I have the pleasure of a few minutes' conversation with you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Glassdale cast a swift glance of surprise, not unmingled with suspicion,
      at the intruder&mdash;the sort of glance that a man used to watchfulness
      would throw at anybody, thought Bryce. But his face cleared as he read the
      card, though it was still doubtful as he lifted it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've the advantage of me, sir," he said. "Dr. Bryce, I see. But&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce smiled and dropped into a garden chair at Glassdale's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You needn't be afraid of talking to me," he answered. "I'm well known in
      Wrychester. The Duke," he went on, nodding his head in the direction of
      the great house which lay behind the woods at the foot of the garden,
      "knows me well enough&mdash;in fact, I was on my way to see his Grace now,
      to ask him if he could tell me where you could be found. The fact is, I'm
      aware of what happened last night&mdash;the jewel affair, you know&mdash;Mitchington
      told me&mdash;and of your friendship with Braden, and I want to ask you a
      question or two about Braden."
    </p>
    <p>
      Glassdale, who had looked somewhat mystified at the beginning of this
      address, seemed to understand matters better by the end of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well, of course, doctor," he said, "if that's it&mdash;but, of course&mdash;a
      word first!&mdash;these folk here at the inn don't know who I am or that
      I've any connection with the Duke on that affair. I'm Mr. Gordon here&mdash;just
      staying for a bit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all right," answered Bryce with a smile of understanding. "All
      this is between ourselves. I saw you with the Duke and the rest of them
      last night, and I recognized you just now. And all I want is a bit of talk
      about Braden. You knew him pretty well of late years?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Knew him for a good many years," replied Glassdale. He looked narrowly at
      his visitor. "I suppose you know his story&mdash;and mine?" he asked.
      "Bygone affairs, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes!" answered Bryce reassuringly. "No need to go into that&mdash;that's
      all done with."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aye&mdash;well, we both put things right," said Glassdale. "Made
      restitution&mdash;both of us, you understand. So that is done with? And
      you know, then, of course, who Braden really was?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "John Brake, ex bank-manager," answered Bryce promptly. "I know all about
      it. I've been deeply interested and concerned in his death. And I'll tell
      you why. I want to marry his daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Glassdale turned and stared at his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His daughter!" he exclaimed. "Brake's daughter! God bless my soul! I
      never knew he had a daughter!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Bryce's turn to stare now. He looked at Glassdale incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean to tell me that you knew Brake all those years and that he
      never mentioned his children?" he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never a word of 'em!" replied Glassdale. "Never knew he had any!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he never speak of his past?" asked Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not in that respect," answered Glassdale. "I'd no idea that he was&mdash;or
      had been&mdash;a married man. He certainly never mentioned wife nor
      children to me, sir, and yet I knew Brake about as intimately as two men
      can know each other for some years before we came back to England."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce fell into one of his fits of musing. What could be the meaning of
      this extraordinary silence on Brake's part? Was there still some hidden
      secret, some other mystery at which he had not yet guessed?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Odd!" he remarked at last after a long pause during which Glassdale had
      watched him curiously. "But, did he ever speak to you of an old friend of
      his named Ransford&mdash;a doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never!" said Glassdale. "Never mentioned such a man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce reflected again, and suddenly determined to be explicit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "John Brake, the bank manager," he said, "was married at a place called
      Braden Medworth, in Leicestershire, to a girl named Mary Bewery. He had
      two children, who would be, respectively, about four and one years of age
      when his&mdash;we'll call it misfortune&mdash;happened. That's a fact!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "First I ever heard of it, then," said Glassdale. "And that's a fact,
      too!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He'd also a very close friend named Ransford&mdash;Mark Ransford,"
      continued Bryce. "This Ransford was best man at Brake's wedding."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never heard him speak of Ransford, nor of any wedding!" affirmed
      Glassdale. "All news to me, doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This Ransford is now in practice in Wrychester," said Bryce. "And he has
      two young people living with him as his wards&mdash;a girl of twenty, a
      boy of seventeen&mdash;who are, without doubt, John Brake's children. It
      is the daughter that I want to marry."
    </p>
    <p>
      Glassdale shook his head as if in sheer perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, all I can say is, you surprise me!" he remarked. "I'd no idea of
      any such thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think Brake came to Wrychester because of that?" asked Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can I answer that, sir, when I tell you that I never heard him
      breathe one word of any children?" exclaimed Glassdale. "No! I know his
      reason for coming to Wrychester. It was wholly and solely&mdash;as far as
      I know&mdash;to tell the Duke here about that jewel business, the secret
      of which had been entrusted to Brake and me by a man on his death-bed in
      Australia. Brake came to Wrychester by himself&mdash;I was to join him
      next morning: we were then to go to see the Duke together. When I got to
      Wrychester, I heard of Brake's accident, and being upset by it, I went
      away again and waited some days until yesterday, when I made up my mind to
      tell the Duke myself, as I did, with very fortunate results. No, that's
      the only reason I know of why Brake came this way. I tell you I knew
      nothing at all of his family affairs! He was a very close man, Brake, and
      apart from his business matters, he'd only one idea in his head, and that
      was lodged there pretty firmly, I can assure you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was it?" asked Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He wanted to find a certain man&mdash;or, rather, two men&mdash;who'd
      cruelly deceived and wronged him, but one of 'em in particular," answered
      Glassdale. "The particular one he believed to be in Australia, until near
      the end, when he got an idea that he'd left for England; as for the other,
      he didn't bother much about him. But the man that he did want!&mdash;ah,
      he wanted him badly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who was that man?" asked Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man of the name of Falkiner Wraye," answered Glassdale promptly. "A man
      he'd known in London. This Wraye, together with his partner, a man called
      Flood, tricked Brake into lending 'em several thousands pounds&mdash;bank's
      money, of course&mdash;for a couple of days&mdash;no more&mdash;and then
      clean disappeared, leaving him to pay the piper! He was a fool, no doubt,
      but he'd been mixed up with them; he'd done it before, and they'd always
      kept their promises, and he did it once too often. He let 'em have some
      thousands; they disappeared, and the bank inspector happened to call at
      Brake's bank and ask for his balances. And&mdash;there he was. And&mdash;that's
      why he'd Falkiner Wraye on his mind&mdash;as his one big idea. T'other man
      was a lesser consideration, Wraye was the chief offender."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you'd tell me all you know about Brake," said Bryce after a pause
      during which he had done some thinking. "Between ourselves, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh&mdash;I don't know that there's so much secrecy!" replied Glassdale
      almost indifferently. "Of course, I knew him first when we were both
      inmates of&mdash;you understand where; no need for particulars. But after
      we left that place, I never saw him again until we met in Australia a few
      years ago. We were both in the same trade&mdash;speculating in wool. We
      got pretty thick and used to see each other a great deal, and of course,
      grew confidential. He told me in time about his affair, and how he'd
      traced this Wraye to the United States, and then, I think, to New Zealand,
      and afterwards to Australia, and as I was knocking about the country a
      great deal buying up wool, he asked me to help him, and gave me a
      description of Wraye, of whom, he said, he'd certainly heard something
      when he first landed at Sydney, but had never been able to trace
      afterwards. But it was no good&mdash;I never either saw or heard of Wraye&mdash;and
      Brake came to the conclusion he'd left Australia. And I know he hoped to
      get news of him, somehow, when we returned to England."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That description, now?&mdash;what was it?" asked Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said Glassdale. "I can't remember it all, now&mdash;big man, clean
      shaven, nothing very particular except one thing. Wraye, according to
      Brake, had a bad scar on his left jaw and had lost the middle finger of
      his left hand&mdash;all from a gun accident. He&mdash;what's the matter,
      sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce had suddenly let his pipe fall from his lips. He took some time in
      picking it up. When he raised himself again his face was calm if a little
      flushed from stooping.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bit my pipe on a bad tooth!" he muttered. "I must have that tooth seen
      to. So you never heard or saw anything of this man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never!" answered Glassdale. "But I've wondered since this Wrychester
      affair if Brake accidentally came across one or other of those men, and if
      his death arose out of it. Now, look here, doctor! I read the accounts of
      the inquest on Brake&mdash;I'd have gone to it if I'd dared, but just then
      I hadn't made up my mind about seeing the Duke; I didn't know what to do,
      so I kept away, and there's a thing has struck me that I don't believe the
      police have ever taken the slightest, notice of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that?" demanded Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, this!" answered Glassdale. "That man who called himself Dellingham&mdash;who
      came with Brake to the Mitre Hotel at Wrychester&mdash;who is he? Where
      did Brake meet him? Where did he go? Seems to me the police have been
      strangely negligent about that! According to the accounts I've read,
      everybody just accepted this Dellingham's first statement, took his word,
      and let him&mdash;vanish! No one, as far as I know, ever verified his
      account of himself. A stranger!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce, who was already in one of his deep moods of reflection, got up from
      his chair as if to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he said. "There maybe something in your suggestion. They certainly
      did take his word without inquiry. It's true&mdash;he mightn't be what he
      said he was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aye, and from what I read, they never followed his movements that
      morning!" observed Glassdale. "Queer business altogether! Isn't there some
      reward offered, doctor? I heard of some placards or something, but I've
      never seen them; of course, I've only been here since yesterday morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce silently drew some papers from his pocket. From them he extracted
      the two handbills which Mitchington had given him and handed them over.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I must go," he said. "I shall no doubt see you again in Wrychester,
      over this affair. For the present, all this is between ourselves, of
      course?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, of course, doctor!" answered Glassdale. "Quite so!" Bryce went off
      and got his bicycle and rode away in the direction of Wrychester. Had he
      remained in that garden he would have seen Glassdale, after reading both
      the handbills, go into the house and have heard him ask the landlady at
      the bar to get him a trap and a good horse in it as soon as possible; he,
      too, now wanted to go to Wrychester and at once. But Bryce was riding down
      the road, muttering certain words to himself over and over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The left jaw&mdash;and the left hand!" he repeated. "Left hand&mdash;left
      jaw! Unmistakable!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. OTHER PEOPLE'S NOTIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The great towers of Wrychester Cathedral had come within Bryce's view
      before he had made up his mind as to the next step in this last stage of
      his campaign. He had ridden away from the Saxonsteade Arms feeling that he
      had got to do something at once, but he was not quite clear in his mind as
      to what that something exactly was. But now, as he topped a rise in the
      road, and saw Wrychester lying in its hollow beneath him, the summer sun
      shining on its red roofs and grey walls, he suddenly came to a decision,
      and instead of riding straight ahead into the old city he turned off at a
      by-road, made a line across the northern outskirts, and headed for the
      golf-links. He was almost certain to find Mary Bewery there at that hour,
      and he wanted to see her at once. The time for his great stroke had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mary Bewery was not there&mdash;had not been there that morning said
      the caddy-master. There were only a few players out. In one of them,
      coming towards the club-house, Bryce recognized Sackville Bonham. And at
      sight of Sackville, Bryce had an inspiration. Mary Bewery would not come
      up to the links now before afternoon; he, Bryce, would lunch there and
      then go towards Wrychester to meet her by the path across the fields on
      which he had waylaid her after his visit to Leicestershire. And meanwhile
      he would inveigle Sackville Bonham into conversation. Sackville fell
      readily into Bryce's trap. He was the sort of youth who loves to talk,
      especially in a hinting and mysterious fashion. And when Bryce, after
      treating him to an appetizer in the bar of the club-house, had suggested
      that they should lunch together and got him into a quiet corner of the
      dining-room, he launched forth at once on the pertinent matter of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heard all about this discovery of those missing Saxonsteade diamonds?" he
      asked as he and Bryce picked up their knives and forks. "Queer business
      that, isn't it? Of course, it's got to do with those murders!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think so?" asked Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can anybody think anything else?" said Sackville in his best dogmatic
      manner. "Why, the thing's plain. From what's been let out&mdash;not much,
      certainly, but enough&mdash;it's quite evident."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's your theory?" inquired Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My stepfather&mdash;knowing old bird he is, too!&mdash;sums the whole
      thing up to a nicety," answered Sackville. "That old chap, Braden, you
      know, is in possession of that secret. He comes to Wrychester about it.
      But somebody else knows. That somebody gets rid of Braden. Why? So that
      the secret'll be known then only to one&mdash;the murderer! See! And why?
      Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, why?" repeated Bryce. "Don't see, so far."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must be dense, then," said Sackville with the lofty superiority of
      youth. "Because of the reward, of course! Don't you know that there's been
      a standing offer&mdash;never withdrawn!&mdash;of five thousand pounds for
      news of those jewels?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I didn't," answered Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fact, sir&mdash;pure fact," continued Sackville. "Now, five thousand,
      divided in two, is two thousand five hundred each. But five thousand,
      undivided, is&mdash;what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Five thousand&mdash;apparently," said Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so! And," remarked Sackville knowingly, "a man'll do a lot for five
      thousand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or&mdash;according to your argument&mdash;for half of it," said Bryce.
      "What you&mdash;or your stepfather's&mdash;aiming at comes to this, that
      suspicion rests on Braden's sharer in the secret. That it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why not?" asked Sackville. "Look at what we know&mdash;from the
      account in the paper this morning. This other chap, Glassdale, waits a bit
      until the first excitement about Braden is over, then he comes forward and
      tells the Duke where the Duchess's diamonds are planted. Why? So that he
      can get the five thousand pound reward! Plain as a pikestaff! Only, the
      police are such fools."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what about Collishaw?" asked Bryce, willing to absorb all his
      companion's ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Part of the game," declared Sackville. "Same man that got rid of Braden
      got rid of that chap! Probably Collishaw knew a bit and had to be
      silenced. But, whether that Glassdale did it all off his own bat or
      whether he's somebody in with him, that's where the guilt'll be fastened
      in the end, my stepfather says. And&mdash;it'll be so. Stands to reason!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anybody come forward about that reward your stepfather offered?" asked
      Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not permitted to say," answered Sackville. "But," he added, leaning
      closer to his companion across the table, "I can tell you this&mdash;there's
      wheels within wheels! You understand! And things'll be coming out. Got to!
      We can't&mdash;as a family&mdash;let Ransford lie under that cloud, don't
      you know. We must clear him. That's precisely why Mr. Folliot offered his
      reward. Ransford, of course, you know, Bryce, is very much to blame&mdash;he
      ought to have done more himself. And, of course, as my mother and my
      stepfather say, if Ransford won't do things for himself, well, we must do
      'em for him! We couldn't think of anything else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good of you all, I'm sure," assented Bryce. "Very thoughtful and
      kindly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well!" said Sackville, who was incapable of perceiving a sneer or of
      knowing when older men were laughing at him. "It's one of those things
      that one's got to do&mdash;under the circumstances. Of course, Miss Bewery
      isn't Dr. Ransford's daughter, but she's his ward, and we can't allow
      suspicion to rest on her guardian. You leave it to me, my boy, and you'll
      see how things will be cleared!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doing a bit underground, eh?" asked Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a bit!" answered Sackville with a knowing wink. "It's the least
      expected that happens&mdash;what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce replied that Sackville was no doubt right, and began to talk of
      other matters. He hung about the club-house until past three o'clock, and
      then, being well acquainted with Mary Bewery's movements from long
      observation of them, set out to walk down towards Wrychester, leaving his
      bicycle behind him. If he did not meet Mary on the way, he meant to go to
      the house. Ransford would be out on his afternoon round of calls; Dick
      Bewery would be at school; he would find Mary alone. And it was necessary
      that he should see her alone, and at once, for since morning an entirely
      new view of affairs had come to him, based on added knowledge, and he now
      saw a chance which he had never seen before. True, he said to himself, as
      he walked across the links and over the country which lay between their
      edge and Wrychester, he had not, even now, the accurate knowledge as to
      the actual murderer of either Braden or Collishaw that he would have
      liked, but he knew something that would enable him to ask Mary Bewery
      point-blank whether he was to be friend or enemy. And he was still
      considering the best way of putting his case to her when, having failed to
      meet her on the way, he at last turned into the Close, and as he
      approached Ransford's house, saw Mrs. Folliot leaving it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Bewery, like Bryce, had been having a day of events. To begin with,
      Ransford had received a wire from London, first thing in the morning,
      which had made him run, breakfastless, to catch the next express. He had
      left Mary to make arrangements about his day's work, for he had not yet
      replaced Bryce, and she had been obliged to seek out another practitioner
      who could find time from his own duties to attend to Ransford's urgent
      patients. Then she had had to see callers who came to the surgery
      expecting to find Ransford there; and in the middle of a busy morning, Mr.
      Folliot had dropped in, to bring her a bunch of roses, and, once admitted,
      had shown unmistakable signs of a desire to gossip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ransford out?" he asked as he sat down in the dining-room. "Suppose he
      is, this time of day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's away," replied Mary. "He went to town by the first express, and I
      have had a lot of bother arranging about his patients."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he hear about this discovery of the Saxonsteade jewels before he
      went?" asked Folliot. "Suppose he wouldn't though&mdash;wasn't known until
      the weekly paper came out this morning. Queer business! You've heard, of
      course?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Short told me," answered Mary. "I don't know any details."
    </p>
    <p>
      Folliot looked meditatively at her a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Got something to do with those other matters, you know," he remarked. "I
      say! What's Ransford doing about all that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About all what, Mr. Folliot?" asked Mary, at once on her guard. "I don't
      understand you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know&mdash;all that suspicion&mdash;and so on," said Folliot. "Bad
      position for a professional man, you know&mdash;ought to clear himself.
      Anybody been applying for that reward Ransford offered?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know anything about it," replied Mary. "Dr. Ransford is very well
      able to take care of himself, I think. Has anybody applied for yours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Folliot rose from his chair again, as if he had changed his mind about
      lingering, and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't say what my solicitors may or may not have heard&mdash;or done," he
      answered. "But&mdash;queer business, you know&mdash;and ought to be
      settled. Bad for Ransford to have any sort of a cloud over him. Sorry to
      see it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that why you came forward with a reward?" asked Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to this direct question Folliot made no answer. He muttered something
      about the advisability of somebody doing something and went away, to
      Mary's relief. She had no desire to discuss the Paradise mysteries with
      anybody, especially after Ransford's assurance of the previous evening.
      But in the middle of the afternoon in walked Mrs. Folliot, a rare caller,
      and before she had been closeted with Mary five minutes brought up the
      subject again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to speak to you on a very serious matter, my dear Miss Bewery,"
      she said. "You must allow me to speak plainly on account of&mdash;of
      several things. My&mdash;my superiority in&mdash;in age, you know, and all
      that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter, Mrs. Folliot?" asked Mary, steeling herself against
      what she felt sure was coming. "Is it&mdash;very serious? And&mdash;pardon
      me&mdash;is it about what Mr. Folliot mentioned to me this morning?
      Because if it is, I'm not going to discuss that with you or with anybody!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had no idea that my husband had been here this morning," answered Mrs.
      Folliot in genuine surprise. "What did he want to talk about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, what do you want to talk about?" asked Mary. "Though that
      doesn't mean that I'm going to talk about it with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Folliot made an effort to understand this remark, and after
      inspecting her hostess critically for a moment, proceeded in her most
      judicial manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must see, my dear Miss Bewery, that it is highly necessary that some
      one should use the utmost persuasion on Dr. Ransford," she said. "He is
      placing all of you&mdash;himself, yourself, your young brother&mdash;in
      most invidious positions by his silence! In society such as&mdash;well,
      such as you get in a cathedral town, you know, no man of reputation can
      afford to keep silence when his&mdash;his character is affected."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary picked up some needlework and began to be much occupied with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Dr. Ransford's character affected?" she asked. "I wasn't aware of it,
      Mrs. Folliot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear, you can't be quite so very&mdash;so very, shall we say
      ingenuous?&mdash;as all that!" exclaimed Mrs. Folliot. "These rumours!&mdash;of
      course, they are very wicked and cruel ones, but you know they have
      spread. Dear me!&mdash;why, they have been common talk!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think my guardian cares twopence for common talk, Mrs. Folliot,"
      answered Mary. "And I am quite sure I don't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "None of us&mdash;especially people in our position&mdash;can afford to
      ignore rumours and common talk," said Mrs. Folliot in her loftiest manner.
      "If we are, unfortunately, talked about, then it is our solemn, bounden
      duty to put ourselves right in the eyes of our friends&mdash;and of
      society. If I for instance, my dear, heard anything affecting my&mdash;let
      me say, moral-character, I should take steps, the most stringent, drastic,
      and forceful steps, to put matters to the test. I would not remain under a
      stigma&mdash;no, not for one minute!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you will never have occasion to rehabilitate your moral character,
      Mrs. Folliot," remarked Mary, bending closely over her work. "Such a
      necessity would indeed be dreadful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet you do not insist&mdash;yes, insist!&mdash;on Dr. Ransford's
      taking strong steps to clear himself!" exclaimed Mrs. Folliot. "Now that,
      indeed, is a dreadful necessity!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Ransford," answered Mary, "is quite able to defend and to take care
      of himself. It is not for me to tell him what to do, or even to advise him
      what to do. And&mdash;since you will talk of this matter, I tell you
      frankly, Mrs. Folliot, that I don't believe any decent person in
      Wrychester has the least suspicion or doubt of Dr. Ransford. His denial of
      any share or complicity in those sad affairs&mdash;the mere idea of it as
      ridiculous as it's wicked&mdash;was quite sufficient. You know very well
      that at that second inquest he said&mdash;on oath, too&mdash;that he knew
      nothing of these affairs. I repeat, there isn't a decent soul in the city
      doubts that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, but you're quite wrong!" said Mrs. Folliot, hurriedly. "Quite wrong,
      I assure you, my dear. Of course, everybody knows what Dr. Ransford said&mdash;very
      excitedly, poor man, I'm given to understand on the occasion you refer to,
      but then, what else could he have said in his own interest? What people
      want is the proof of his innocence. I could&mdash;but I won't&mdash;tell
      you of many of the very best people who are&mdash;well, very much
      exercised over the matter&mdash;I could indeed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you count yourself among them?" asked Mary in a cold fashion which
      would have been a warning to any one but her visitor. "Am I to understand
      that, Mrs. Folliot?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not, my dear," answered Mrs. Folliot promptly. "Otherwise I
      should not have done what I have done towards establishing the foolish
      man's innocence!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary dropped her work and turned a pair of astonished eyes on Mrs.
      Folliot's large countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You!" she exclaimed. "To establish&mdash;Dr. Ransford's innocence? Why,
      Mrs. Folliot, what have you done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Folliot toyed a little with the jewelled head of her sunshade. Her
      expression became almost coy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well!" she answered after a brief spell of indecision. "Perhaps it is
      as well that you should know, Miss Bewery. Of course, when all this sad
      trouble was made far worse by that second affair&mdash;the working-man's
      death, you know, I said to my husband that really one must do something,
      seeing that Dr. Ransford was so very, very obdurate and wouldn't speak.
      And as money is nothing&mdash;at least as things go&mdash;to me or to Mr.
      Folliot, I insisted that he should offer a thousand pounds reward to have
      the thing cleared up. He's a generous and open-handed man, and he agreed
      with me entirely, and put the thing in hand through his solicitors. And
      nothing would please us more, my dear, than to have that thousand pounds
      claimed! For of course, if there is to be&mdash;as I suppose there is&mdash;a
      union between our families, it would be utterly impossible that any cloud
      could rest on Dr. Ransford, even if he is only your guardian. My son's
      future wife cannot, of course&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary laid down her work again and for a full minute stared Mrs. Folliot in
      the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Folliot!" she said at last. "Are you under the impression that I'm
      thinking of marrying your son?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I've every good reason for believing it!" replied Mrs. Folliot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've none!" retorted Mary, gathering up her work and moving towards the
      door. "I've no more intention of marrying Mr. Sackville Bonham than of
      eloping with the Bishop! The idea's too absurd to&mdash;even be thought
      of!"

    <p>
      Five minutes later Mrs. Folliot, heightened in colour, had gone. And
      presently Mary, glancing after her across the Close, saw Bryce approaching
      the gate of the garden.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. THE UNEXPECTED
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mary's first instinct on seeing the approach of Pemberton Bryce, the one
      man she least desired to see, was to retreat to the back of the house and
      send the parlourmaid to the door to say her mistress was not at home. But
      she had lately become aware of Bryce's curiously dogged persistence in
      following up whatever he had in view, and she reflected that if he were
      sent away then he would be sure to come back and come back until he had
      got whatever it was that he wanted. And after a moment's further
      consideration, she walked out of the front door and confronted him
      resolutely in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Ransford is away," she said with almost unnecessary brusqueness.
      "He's away until evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want him," replied Bryce just as brusquely. "I came to see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary hesitated. She continued to regard Bryce steadily, and Bryce did not
      like the way in which she was looking at him. He made haste to speak
      before she could either leave or dismiss him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd better give me a few minutes," he said, with a note of warning.
      "I'm here in your interests&mdash;or in Ransford's. I may as well tell
      you, straight out, Ransford's in serious and imminent danger! That's a
      fact."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Danger of what?" she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Arrest&mdash;instant arrest!" replied Bryce. "I'm telling you the truth.
      He'll probably be arrested tonight, on his return. There's no imagination
      in all this&mdash;I'm speaking of what I know. I've&mdash;curiously enough&mdash;got
      mixed up with these affairs, through no seeking of my own, and I know
      what's behind the scenes. If it were known that I'm letting out secrets to
      you, I should get into trouble. But, I want to warn you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary stood before him on the path, hesitating. She knew enough to know
      that Bryce was telling some sort of truth: it was plain that he had been
      mixed up in the recent mysteries, and there was a ring of conviction in
      his voice which impressed her. And suddenly she had visions of Ransford's
      arrest, of his being dragged off to prison to meet a cruel accusation, of
      the shame and disgrace, and she hesitated further.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if that's so," she said at last, "what's the good of coming to me? I
      can't do anything!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can!" said Bryce significantly. "I know more&mdash;much more&mdash;than
      the police know&mdash;more than anybody knows. I can save Ransford.
      Understand that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you want now?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To talk to you&mdash;to tell you how things are," answered Bryce. "What
      harm is there in that? To make you see how matters stand, and then to show
      you what I can do to put things right."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary glanced at an open summer-house which stood beneath the beech trees
      on one side of the garden. She moved towards it and sat down there, and
      Bryce followed her and seated himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce realized that his moment had arrived. He paused, endeavouring to
      remember the careful preparations he had made for putting his case.
      Somehow, he was not so clear as to his line of attack as he had been ten
      minutes previously&mdash;he realized that he had to deal with a young
      woman who was not likely to be taken in nor easily deceived. And suddenly
      he plunged into what he felt to be the thick of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whether you, or whether Ransford&mdash;whether both or either of you,
      know it or not," he said, "the police have been on to Ransford ever since
      that Collishaw affair! Underground work, you know. Mitchington has been
      digging into things ever since then, and lately he's had a London
      detective helping him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary, who had carried her work into the garden, had now resumed it, and as
      Bryce began to talk she bent over it steadily stitching.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here!" continued Bryce. "Has it never struck you&mdash;it must have
      done!&mdash;that there's considerable mystery about Ransford? But whether
      it has struck you or not, it's there, and it's struck the police forcibly.
      Mystery connected with him before&mdash;long before&mdash;he ever came
      here. And associated, in some way, with that man Braden. Not of late&mdash;in
      years past. And, naturally, the police have tried to find out what that
      was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have they found out?" asked Mary quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I'm not at liberty to tell," replied Bryce. "But I can tell you this&mdash;they
      know, Mitchington and the London man, that there were passages between
      Ransford and Braden years ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How many years ago?" interrupted Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce hesitated a moment. He had a suspicion that this self-possessed
      young woman who was taking everything more quietly than he had
      anticipated, might possibly know more than he gave her credit for knowing.
      He had been watching her fingers since they sat down in the summer-house,
      and his sharp eyes saw that they were as steady as the spire of the
      cathedral above the trees&mdash;he knew from that that she was neither
      frightened nor anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well&mdash;seventeen to twenty years ago," he answered. "About that
      time. There were passages, I say, and they were of a nature which suggests
      that the re-appearance of Braden on Ransford's present stage of life would
      be, extremely unpleasant and unwelcome to Ransford."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vague!" murmured Mary. "Extremely vague!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But quite enough," retorted Bryce, "to give the police the suggestion of
      motive. I tell you the police know quite enough to know that Braden was,
      of all men in the world, the last man Ransford desired to see cross his
      path again. And&mdash;on that morning on which the Paradise affair
      occurred&mdash;Braden did cross his path. Therefore, in the conventional
      police way of thinking and looking at things, there's motive."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Motive for what?" asked Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce arrived here at one of his critical stages, and he paused a moment
      in order to choose his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't get any false ideas or impressions," he said at last. "I'm not
      accusing Ransford of anything. I'm only telling you what I know the police
      think and are on the very edge of accusing him of. To put it plainly&mdash;of
      murder. They say he'd a motive for murdering Braden&mdash;and with them
      motive is everything. It's the first thing they seem to think of; they
      first question they ask themselves. 'Why should this man have murdered
      that man?'&mdash;do you see! 'What motive had he?&mdash;that's the point.
      And they think&mdash;these chaps like Mitchington and the London man&mdash;that
      Ransford certainly had a motive for getting rid of Braden when they met."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was the motive?" asked Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They've found out something&mdash;perhaps a good deal&mdash;about what
      happened between Braden and Ransford some years ago," replied Bryce. "And
      their theory is&mdash;if you want to know the truth&mdash;that Ransford
      ran away with Braden's wife, and that Braden had been looking for him ever
      since."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce had kept his eyes on Mary's hands, and now at last he saw the girl's
      fingers tremble. But her voice was steady enough when she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that mere conjecture on their part, or is it based on any fact?" she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not in full knowledge of all their secrets," answered Bryce, "but
      I've heard enough to know that there's a basis of undeniable fact on which
      they're going. I know for instance, beyond doubt, that Braden and Ransford
      were bosom friends, years ago, that Braden was married to a girl whom
      Ransford had wanted to marry, that Braden's wife suddenly left him,
      mysteriously, a few years later, and that, at the same time, Ransford made
      an equally mysterious disappearance. The police know all that. What is the
      inference to be drawn? What inference would any one&mdash;you yourself,
      for example&mdash;draw?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None, till I've heard what Dr. Ransford had to say," replied Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce disliked that ready retort. He was beginning to feel that he was
      being met by some force stronger than his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all very well," he remarked. "I don't say that I wouldn't do the
      same. But I'm only explaining the police position, and showing you the
      danger likely to arise from it. The police theory is this, as far as I can
      make it out: Ransford, years ago, did Braden a wrong, and Braden certainly
      swore revenge when he could find him. Circumstances prevented Braden from
      seeking him closely for some time; at last they met here, by accident.
      Here the police aren't decided. One theory is that there was an
      altercation, blows, a struggle, in the course of which Braden met his
      death; the other is that Ransford deliberately took Braden up into the
      gallery and flung him through that open doorway&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That," observed Mary, with something very like a sneer, "seems so likely
      that I should think it would never occur to anybody but the sort of people
      you're telling me of! No man of any real sense would believe it for a
      minute!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some people of plain common sense do believe it for all that!" retorted
      Bryce. "For it's quite possible. But as I say, I'm only repeating. And of
      course, the rest of it follows on that. The police theory is that
      Collishaw witnessed Braden's death at Ransford's hands, that Ransford got
      to know that Collishaw knew of that, and that he therefore quietly removed
      Collishaw. And it is on all that that they're going, and will go. Don't
      ask me if I think they're right or wrong! I'm only telling you what I know
      so as to show you what danger Ransford is in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary made no immediate answer, and Bryce sat watching her. Somehow&mdash;he
      was at a loss to explain it to himself&mdash;things were not going as he
      had expected. He had confidently believed that the girl would be
      frightened, scared, upset, ready to do anything that he asked or
      suggested. But she was plainly not frightened. And the fingers which
      busied themselves with the fancy-work had become steady again, and her
      voice had been steady all along.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray," she asked suddenly, and with a little satirical inflection of
      voice which Brice was quick to notice, "pray, how is it that you&mdash;not
      a policeman, not a detective!&mdash;come to know so much of all this?
      Since when were you taken into the confidence of Mitchington and the
      mysterious person from London?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know as well as I do that I have been dragged into the case against
      my wishes," answered Bryce almost sullenly. "I was fetched to Braden&mdash;I
      saw him die. It was I who found Collishaw&mdash;dead. Of course, I've been
      mixed up, whether I would or not, and I've had to see a good deal of the
      police, and naturally I've learnt things."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary suddenly turned on him with a flash of the eye which might have
      warned Bryce that he had signally failed in the main feature of his
      adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what have you learnt that makes you come here and tell me all this?"
      she exclaimed. "Do you think I'm a simpleton, Dr. Bryce? You set out by
      saying that Dr. Ransford is in danger from the police, and that you know
      more&mdash;much more than the police! what does that mean? Shall I tell
      you? It means that you&mdash;you!&mdash;know that the police are wrong,
      and that if you like you can prove to them that they are wrong! Now, then
      isn't that so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am in possession of certain facts," began Bryce. "I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary stopped him with a look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My turn!" she said. "You're in possession of certain facts. Now isn't it
      the truth that the facts you are in possession of are proof enough to you
      that Dr. Ransford is as innocent as I am? It's no use your trying to
      deceive me! Isn't that so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could certainly turn the police off his track," admitted Bryce, who was
      growing highly uncomfortable. "I could divert&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary gave him another look and dropping her needlework continued to watch
      him steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you call yourself a gentleman?" she asked quietly. "Or we'll leave the
      term out. Do you call yourself even decently honest? For, if you do, how
      can you have the sheer impudence&mdash;more, insolence!&mdash;to come here
      and tell me all this when you know that the police are wrong and that you
      could&mdash;to use your own term, which is your way of putting it&mdash;turn
      them off the wrong track? Whatever sort of man are you? Do you want to
      know my opinion of you in plain words?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem very anxious to give it, anyway," retorted Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will give it, and it will perhaps put an end to this," answered Mary.
      "If you are in possession of anything in the way of evidence which would
      prove Dr. Ransford's innocence and you are wilfully suppressing it, you
      are bad, wicked, base, cruel, unfit for any decent being's society! And,"
      she added, as she picked up her work and rose, "you're not going to have
      any more of mine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A moment!" said Bryce. He was conscious that he had somehow played all
      his cards badly, and he wanted another opening. "You're misunderstanding
      me altogether! I never said&mdash;never inferred&mdash;that I wouldn't
      save Ransford."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, if there's need, which I don't admit, you acknowledge that you
      could save him?" she exclaimed sharply. "Just as I thought. Then, if
      you're an honest man, a man with any pretensions to honour, why don't you
      at once! Any man who had such feelings as those I've just mentioned
      wouldn't hesitate one second. But you&mdash;you!&mdash;you come and&mdash;talk
      about it! As if it were a game! Dr. Bryce, you make me feel sick,
      mentally, morally sick."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce had risen to his feet when Mary rose, and he now stood staring at
      her. Ever since his boyhood he had laughed and sneered at the mere idea of
      the finer feelings&mdash;he believed that every man has his price&mdash;and
      that honesty and honour are things useful as terms but of no real
      existence. And now he was wondering&mdash;really wondering&mdash;if this
      girl meant the things she said: if she really felt a mental loathing of
      such minds and purposes as he knew his own were, or if it were merely
      acting on her part. Before he could speak she turned on him again more
      fiercely than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I tell you something else in plain language?" she asked. "You
      evidently possess a very small and limited knowledge&mdash;if you have any
      at all!&mdash;of women, and you apparently don't rate their mental
      qualities at any high standard. Let me tell you that I am not quite such a
      fool as you seem to think me! You came here this afternoon to bargain with
      me! You happen to know how much I respect my guardian and what I owe him
      for the care he has taken of me and my brother. You thought to trade on
      that! You thought you could make a bargain with me; you were to save Dr.
      Ransford, and for reward you were to have me! You daren't deny it. Dr.
      Bryce&mdash;I can see through you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never said it, at any rate," answered Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once more, I say, I'm not a fool!" exclaimed Mary. "I saw through you all
      along. And you've failed! I'm not in the least frightened by what you've
      said. If the police arrest Dr. Ransford, Dr. Ransford knows how to defend
      himself. And you're not afraid for him! You know you aren't. It wouldn't
      matter twopence to you if he were hanged tomorrow, for you hate him. But
      look to yourself! Men who cheat, and scheme, and plot, and plan as you do
      come to bad ends. Mind yours! Mind the wheel doesn't come full circle. And
      now, if you please, go away and don't dare to come near me again!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce made no answer. He had listened, with an attempt at a smile, to all
      this fiery indignation, but as Mary spoke the last words he was suddenly
      aware of something that drew his attention from her and them. Through an
      opening in Ransford's garden hedge he could see the garden door of the
      Folliots' house across the Close. And at that moment out of it emerge
      Folliot himself in conversation with Glassdale!
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a word, Bryce snatched up his hat from the table of the
      summer-house, and went swiftly away&mdash;a new scheme, a new idea in his
      mind.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV. FINESSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Glassdale, journeying into Wrychester half an hour after Bryce had left
      him at the Saxonsteade Arms, occupied himself during his ride across
      country in considering the merits of the two handbills which Bryce had
      given him. One announced an offer of five hundred pounds reward for
      information in the Braden-Collishaw matter; the other, of a thousand
      pounds. It struck him as a curious thing that two offers should be made&mdash;it
      suggested, at once, that more than one person was deeply interested in
      this affair. But who were they?&mdash;no answer to that question appeared
      on the handbills, which were, in each case, signed by Wrychester
      solicitors. To one of these Glassdale, on arriving in the old city,
      promptly proceeded&mdash;selecting the offerer of the larger reward. He
      presently found himself in the presence of an astute-looking man who,
      having had his visitor's name sent in to him, regarded Glassdale with very
      obvious curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Glassdale?" he said inquiringly, as the caller took an offered chair.
      "Are you, by any chance, the Mr. Glassdale whose name is mentioned in
      connection with last night's remarkable affair?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He pointed to a copy of the weekly newspaper, lying on his desk, and to a
      formal account of the discovery of the Saxonsteade jewels which had been
      furnished to the press, at the Duke's request, by Mitchington. Glassdale
      glanced at it&mdash;unconcernedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The same," he answered. "But I didn't call here on that matter&mdash;though
      what I did call about is certainly relative to it. You've offered a reward
      for any information that would lead to the solution of that mystery about
      Braden&mdash;and the other man, Collishaw."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of a thousand pounds&mdash;yes!" replied the solicitor, looking at his
      visitor with still more curiosity, mingled with expectancy. "Can you give
      any?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Glassdale pulled out the two handbills which he had obtained from Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are two rewards offered," he remarked. "Are they entirely
      independent of each other?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We know nothing of the other," answered the solicitor. "Except, of
      course, that it exists. They're quite independent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who's offering the five hundred pound one?" asked Glassdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      The solicitor paused, looking his man over. He saw at once that Glassdale
      had, or believed he had, something to tell&mdash;and was disposed to be
      unusually cautious about telling it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he replied, after a pause. "I believe&mdash;in fact, it's an open
      secret&mdash;that the offer of five hundred pounds is made by Dr.
      Ransford."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And&mdash;yours?" inquired Glassdale. "Who's at the back of yours&mdash;a
      thousand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The solicitor smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You haven't answered my question, Mr. Glassdale," he observed. "Can you
      give any information?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Glassdale threw his questioner a significant glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whatever information I might give," he said, "I'd only give to a
      principal&mdash;the principal. From what I've seen and known of all this,
      there's more in it than is on the surface. I can tell something. I knew
      John Braden&mdash;who, of course, was John Brake&mdash;very well, for some
      years. Naturally, I was in his confidence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "About more than the Saxonsteade jewels, you mean?" asked the solicitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "About more than that," assented Glassdale. "Private matters. I've no
      doubt I can throw some light&mdash;some!&mdash;on this Wrychester Paradise
      affair. But, as I said just now, I'll only deal with the principal. I
      wouldn't tell you, for instance&mdash;as your principal's solicitor."
    </p>
    <p>
      The solicitor smiled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your ideas, Mr. Glassdale, appear to fit in with our principal's," he
      remarked. "His instructions&mdash;strict instructions&mdash;to us are that
      if anybody turns up who can give any information, it's not to be given to
      us, but to&mdash;himself!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wise man!" observed Glassdale. "That's just what I feel about it. It's a
      mistake to share secrets with more than one person."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a secret, then!" asked the solicitor, half slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Might be," replied Glassdale. "Who's your client?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The solicitor pulled a scrap of paper towards him and wrote a few words on
      it. He pushed it towards his caller, and Glassdale picked it up and read
      what had been written&mdash;Mr. Stephen Folliot, The Close.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd better go and see him," said the solicitor, suggestively. "You'll
      find him reserved enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      Glassdale read and re-read the name&mdash;as if he were endeavouring to
      recollect it, or connect it with something.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What particular reason has this man for wishing to find this out?" he
      inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't say, my good sir!" replied the solicitor, with a smile. "Perhaps
      he'll tell you. He hasn't told me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Glassdale rose to take his leave. But with his hand on the door he turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this gentleman a resident in the place?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A well-known townsman," replied the solicitor. "You'll easily find his
      house in the Close&mdash;everybody knows it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Glassdale went away then&mdash;and walked slowly towards the Cathedral
      precincts. On his way he passed two places at which he was half inclined
      to call&mdash;one was the police-station; the other, the office of the
      solicitors who were acting on behalf of the offerer of five hundred
      pounds. He half glanced at the solicitor's door&mdash;but on reflection
      went forward. A man who was walking across the Close pointed out the
      Folliot residence&mdash;Glassdale entered by the garden door, and in
      another minute came face to face with Folliot himself, busied, as usual,
      amongst his rose-trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glassdale saw Folliot and took stock of him before Folliot knew that a
      stranger was within his gates. Folliot, in an old jacket which he kept for
      his horticultural labours, was taking slips from a standard; he looked as
      harmless and peaceful as his occupation. A quiet, inoffensive, somewhat
      benevolent elderly man, engaged in work, which suggested leisure and
      peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Glassdale, after a first quick, searching glance, took another and
      longer one&mdash;and went nearer with a discreet laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Folliot turned quietly, and seeing the stranger, showed no surprise. He
      had a habit of looking over the top rims of his spectacles at people, and
      he looked in this way at Glassdale, glancing him up and down calmly.
      Glassdale lifted his slouch hat and advanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Folliot, I believe, sir?" he said. "Mr. Stephen Folliot?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aye, just so!" responded Folliot. "But I don't know you. Who may you be,
      now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name, sir, is Glassdale," answered the other. "I've just come from
      your solicitor's. I called to see him this afternoon&mdash;and he told me
      that the business I called about could only be dealt with&mdash;or
      discussed&mdash;with you. So&mdash;I came here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Folliot, who had been cutting slips off a rose-tree, closed his knife and
      put it away in his old jacket. He turned and quietly inspected his visitor
      once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aye!" he said quietly. "So you're after that thousand pound reward, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should have no objection to it, Mr. Folliot," replied Glassdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dare say not," remarked Folliot, dryly. "I dare say not! And which are
      you, now?&mdash;one of those who think they can tell something, or one
      that really can tell? Eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll know that better when we've had a bit of talk, Mr. Folliot,"
      answered Glassdale, accompanying his reply with a direct glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well, now then, I've no objection to a bit of talk&mdash;none
      whatever!" said Folliot. "Here!&mdash;we'll sit down on that bench,
      amongst the roses. Quite private here&mdash;nobody about. And now," he
      continued, as Glassdale accompanied him to a rustic bench set beneath a
      pergola of rambler roses, "who are you, like? I read a queer account in
      this morning's local paper of what happened in the Cathedral grounds
      yonder last night, and there was a person of your name mentioned. Are you
      that Glassdale?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The same, Mr. Folliot," answered the visitor, promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you knew Braden&mdash;the man who lost his life here?" asked
      Folliot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well indeed," replied Glassdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For how long?" demanded Folliot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some years&mdash;as a mere acquaintance, seen now and then," said
      Glassdale. "A few years, recently, as what you might call a close friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell you any of his secrets?" asked Folliot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he did!" answered Glassdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anything that seems to relate to his death&mdash;and the mystery about
      it?" inquired Folliot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think so," said Glassdale. "Upon consideration, I think so!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah&mdash;and what might it be, now?" continued Folliot. He gave Glassdale
      a look which seemed to denote and imply several things. "It might be to
      your advantage to explain a bit, you know," he added. "One has to be a
      little&mdash;vague, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was a certain man that Braden was very anxious to find," said
      Glassdale. "He'd been looking for him for a good many years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man?" asked Folliot. "One?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, as a matter of fact, there were two," admitted Glassdale, "but
      there was one in particular. The other&mdash;the second&mdash;so Braden
      said, didn't matter; he was or had been, only a sort of cat's-paw of the
      man he especially wanted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," said Folliot. He pulled out a cigar case and offered a cigar to
      his visitor, afterwards lighting one himself. "And what did Braden want
      that man for?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glassdale waited until his cigar was in full going order before he
      answered this question. Then he replied in one word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Revenge!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Folliot put his thumbs in the armholes of his buff waistcoat and leaning
      back, seemed to be admiring his roses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" he said at last. "Revenge, now? A sort of vindictive man, was he?
      Wanted to get his knife into somebody, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He wanted to get something of his own back from a man who'd done him,"
      answered Glassdale, with a short laugh. "That's about it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      For a minute or two both men smoked in silence. Then Folliot&mdash;still
      regarding his roses&mdash;put a leading question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give you any details?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough," said Glassdale. "Braden had been done&mdash;over a money
      transaction&mdash;by these men&mdash;one especially, as head and front of
      the affair&mdash;and it had cost him&mdash;more than anybody would think!
      Naturally, he wanted&mdash;if he ever got the chance&mdash;his revenge.
      Who wouldn't?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he'd tracked 'em down, eh?" asked Folliot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are questions I can answer, and there are questions I can't
      answer," responded Glassdale. "That's one of the questions I've no reply
      to. For&mdash;I don't know! But&mdash;I can say this. He hadn't tracked
      'em down the day before he came to Wrychester!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're sure of that?" asked Folliot. "He&mdash;didn't come here on that
      account?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I'm sure he didn't!" answered Glassdale, readily. "If he had, I
      should have known. I was with him till noon the day he came here&mdash;in
      London&mdash;and when he took his ticket at Victoria for Wrychester, he'd
      no more idea than the man in the moon as to where those men had got to. He
      mentioned it as we were having a bit of lunch together before he got into
      the train. No&mdash;he didn't come to Wrychester for any such purpose as
      that! But&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused and gave Folliot a meaning glance out of the corner of his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aye&mdash;what?" asked Folliot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think he met at least one of 'em here," said Glassdale, quietly. "And&mdash;perhaps
      both."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leading to&mdash;misfortune for him?" suggested Folliot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you like to put it that way&mdash;yes," assented Glassdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Folliot smoked a while in more reflective silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aye, well!" he said at last. "I suppose you haven't put these ideas of
      yours before anybody, now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Present ideas?" asked Glassdale, sharply. "Not to a soul! I've not had
      'em&mdash;very long."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're the sort of man that another man can do a deal with, I suppose?"
      suggested Folliot. "That is, if it's made worth your while, of course?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shouldn't wonder," replied Glassdale. "And&mdash;if it is made worth my
      while."
    </p>
    <p>
      Folliot mused a little. Then he tapped Glassdale's elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see," he said, confidentially, "it might be, you know, that I had a
      little purpose of my own in offering that reward. It might be that it was
      a very particular friend of mine that had the misfortune to have incurred
      this man Braden's hatred. And I might want to save him, d'ye see, from&mdash;well,
      from the consequence of what's happened, and to hear about it first if
      anybody came forward, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I've done," said Glassdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As&mdash;you've done," assented Folliot. "Now, perhaps it would be in the
      interest of this particular friend of mine if he made it worth your while
      to&mdash;say no more to anybody, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very much worth his while, Mr. Folliot," declared Glassdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aye, well," continued Folliot. "This very particular friend would just
      want to know, you know, how much you really, truly know! Now, for
      instance, about these two men&mdash;and one in particular&mdash;that
      Braden was after? Did&mdash;did he name 'em?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Glassdale leaned a little nearer to his companion on the rose-screened
      bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He named them&mdash;to me!" he said in a whisper. "One was a man called
      Falkiner Wraye, and the other man was a man named Flood. Is that enough?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you'd better come and see me this evening," answered Folliot.
      "Come just about dusk to that door&mdash;I'll meet you there. Fine roses
      these of mine, aren't they?" he continued, as they rose. "I occupy myself
      entirely with 'em."
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked with Glassdale to the garden door, and stood there watching his
      visitor go away up the side of the high wall until he turned into the path
      across Paradise. And then, as Folliot was retreating to his roses, he saw
      Bryce coming over the Close&mdash;and Bryce beckoned to him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV. THE OLD WELL HOUSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Bryce came hurrying up to him, Folliot was standing at his garden
      door with his hands thrust under his coat-tails&mdash;the very picture of
      a benevolent, leisured gentleman who has nothing to do and is disposed to
      give his time to anybody. He glanced at Bryce as he had glanced at
      Glassdale&mdash;over the tops of his spectacles, and the glance had no
      more than mild inquiry in it. But if Bryce had been less excited, he would
      have seen that Folliot, as he beckoned him inside the garden, swept a
      sharp look over the Close and ascertained that there was no one about,
      that Bryce's entrance was unobserved. Save for a child or two, playing
      under the tall elms near one of the gates, and for a clerical figure that
      stalked a path in the far distance, the Close was empty of life. And there
      was no one about, either, in that part of Folliot's big garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want a bit of talk with you," said Bryce as Folliot closed the door and
      turned down a side-path to a still more retired region. "Private talk.
      Let's go where it's quiet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Without replying in words to this suggestion, Folliot led the way through
      his rose-trees to a far corner of his grounds, where an old building of
      grey stone, covered with ivy, stood amongst high trees. He turned the key
      of a doorway and motioned Bryce to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quiet enough in here, doctor," he observed. "You've never seen this place&mdash;bit
      of a fancy of mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce, absorbed as he was in the thoughts of the moment, glanced cursorily
      at the place into which Folliot had led him. It was a square building of
      old stone, its walls unlined, unplastered; its floor paved with much worn
      flags of limestone, evidently set down in a long dead age and now polished
      to marble-like smoothness. In its midst, set flush with the floor, was
      what was evidently a trap-door, furnished with a heavy iron ring. To this
      Folliot pointed, with a glance of significant interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Deepest well in all Wrychester under that," he remarked. "You'd never
      think it&mdash;it's a hundred feet deep&mdash;and more! Dry now&mdash;water
      gave out some years ago. Some people would have pulled this old well-house
      down&mdash;but not me! I did better&mdash;I turned it to good account." He
      raised a hand and pointed upward to an obviously modern ceiling of strong
      oak timbers. "Had that put in," he continued, "and turned the top of the
      building into a little snuggery. Come up!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He led the way to a flight of steps in one corner of the lower room,
      pushed open a door at their head, and showed his companion into a small
      apartment arranged and furnished in something closely approaching to
      luxury. The walls were hung with thick fabrics; the carpeting was equally
      thick; there were pictures, books, and curiosities; the two or three
      chairs were deep and big enough to lie down in; the two windows commanded
      pleasant views of the Cathedral towers on one side and of the Close on the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nice little place to be alone in, d'ye see?" said Folliot. "Cool in
      summer&mdash;warm in winter&mdash;modern fire-grate, you notice. Come here
      when I want to do a bit of quiet thinking, what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good place for that&mdash;certainly," agreed Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Folliot pointed his visitor to one of the big chairs and turning to a
      cabinet brought out some glasses, a syphon of soda-water, and a heavy
      cut-glass decanter. He nodded at a box of cigars which lay open on a table
      at Bryce's elbow as he began to mix a couple of drinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Help yourself," he said. "Good stuff, those."
    </p>
    <p>
      Not until he had given Bryce a drink, and had carried his own glass to
      another easy chair did Folliot refer to any reason for Bryce's visit. But
      once settled down, he looked at him speculatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you want to see me about?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce, who had lighted a cigar, looked across its smoke at the
      imperturbable face opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've just had Glassdale here," he observed quietly. "I saw him leave
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Folliot nodded&mdash;without any change of expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aye, doctor," he said. "And&mdash;what do you know about Glassdale, now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce, who would have cheerfully hobnobbed with a man whom he was about to
      conduct to the scaffold, lifted his glass and drank.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A good deal," he answered as he set the glass down. "The fact is&mdash;I
      came here to tell you so!&mdash;I know a good deal about everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A wide term!" remarked Folliot. "You've got some limitation to it, I
      should think. What do you mean by&mdash;everything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean about recent matters," replied Bryce. "I've interested myself in
      them&mdash;for reasons of my own. Ever since Braden was found at the foot
      of those stairs in Paradise, and I was fetched to him, I've interested
      myself. And&mdash;I've discovered a great deal&mdash;more, much more
      than's known to anybody."
    </p>
    <p>
      Folliot threw one leg over the other and began to jog his foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" he said after a pause. "Dear me! And&mdash;what might you know, now,
      doctor? Aught you can tell me eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lots!" answered Bryce. "I came to tell you&mdash;on seeing that Glassdale
      had been with you. Because&mdash;I was with Glassdale this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      Folliot made no answer. But Bryce saw that his cool, almost indifferent
      manner was changing&mdash;he was beginning, under the surface, to get
      anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I left Glassdale&mdash;at noon," continued Bryce, "I'd no idea&mdash;and
      I don't think he had&mdash;that he was coming to see you. But I know what
      put the notion into his head. I gave him copies of those two reward bills.
      He no doubt thought he might make a bit&mdash;and so he came in to town,
      and&mdash;to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" asked Folliot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shouldn't wonder," remarked Bryce, reflectively, and almost as if
      speaking to himself, "I shouldn't at all wonder if Glassdale's the sort of
      man who can be bought. He, no doubt, has his price. But all that Glassdale
      knows is nothing&mdash;to what I know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Folliot had allowed his cigar to go out. He threw it away, took a fresh
      one from the box, and slowly struck a match and lighted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What might you know, now?" he asked after another pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've a bit of a faculty for finding things out," answered Bryce boldly.
      "And I've developed it. I wanted to know all about Braden&mdash;and about
      who killed him&mdash;and why. There's only one way of doing all that sort
      of thing, you know. You've got to go back&mdash;a long way back&mdash;to
      the very beginnings. I went back&mdash;to the time when Braden was
      married. Not as Braden, of course&mdash;but as who he really was&mdash;John
      Brake. That was at a place called Braden Medworth, near Barthorpe, in
      Leicestershire."
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused there, watching Folliot. But Folliot showed no more than close
      attention, and Bryce went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not much in that&mdash;for the really important part of the story," he
      continued. "But Brake had other associations with Barthorpe&mdash;a bit
      later. He got to know&mdash;got into close touch with a Barthorpe man who,
      about the time of Brake's marriage, left Barthorpe end settled in London.
      Brake and this man began to have some secret dealings together. There was
      another man in with them, too&mdash;a man who was a sort of partner of the
      Barthorpe man's. Brake had evidently a belief in these men, and he trusted
      them&mdash;unfortunately for himself he sometimes trusted the bank's money
      to them. I know what happened&mdash;he used to let them have money for
      short financial transactions&mdash;to be refunded within a very brief
      space. But&mdash;he went to the fire too often, and got his fingers burned
      in the end. The two men did him&mdash;one of them in particular&mdash;and
      cleared out. He had to stand the racket. He stood it&mdash;to the tune of
      ten years' penal servitude. And, naturally, when he'd finished his time,
      he wanted to find those two men&mdash;and began a long search for them.
      Like to know the names of the men, Mr. Folliot?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might mention 'em&mdash;if you know 'em," answered Folliot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The name of the particular one was Wraye&mdash;Falkiner Wraye," replied
      Bryce promptly. "Of the other&mdash;the man of lesser importance&mdash;Flood."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men looked quietly at each other for a full moment's silence. And
      it was Bryce who first spoke with a ring of confidence in his tone which
      showed that he knew he had the whip hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I tell you something about Falkiner Wraye?" he asked. "I will!&mdash;it's
      deeply interesting. Mr. Falkiner Wraye, after cheating and deceiving
      Brake, and leaving him to pay the penalty of his over-trustfulness,
      cleared out of England and carried his money-making talents to foreign
      parts. He succeeded in doing well&mdash;he would!&mdash;and eventually he
      came back and married a rich widow and settled himself down in an
      out-of-the-world English town to grow roses. You're Falkiner Wraye, you
      know, Mr. Folliot!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce laughed as he made this direct accusation, and sitting forward in
      his chair, pointed first to Folliot's face and then to his left hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Falkiner Wraye," he said, "had an unfortunate gun accident in his youth
      which marked him for life. He lost the middle finger of his left hand, and
      he got a bad scar on his left jaw. There they are, those marks! Fortunate
      for you, Mr. Folliot, that the police don't know all that I know, for if
      they did, those marks would have done for you days ago!" For a minute or
      two Folliot sat joggling his leg&mdash;a bad sign in him of rising temper
      if Bryce had but known it. While he remained silent he watched Bryce
      narrowly, and when he spoke, his voice was calm as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what use do you intend to put your knowledge to, if one may ask?" he
      inquired, half sneeringly. "You said just now that you'd no doubt that man
      Glassdale could be bought, and I'm inclining to think that you're one of
      those men that have their price. What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We've not come to that," retorted Bryce. "You're a bit mistaken. If I
      have my price, it's not in the same commodity that Glassdale would want.
      But before we do any talking about that sort of thing, I want to add to my
      stock of knowledge. Look here! We'll be candid. I don't care a snap of my
      fingers that Brake, or Braden's dead, or that Collishaw's dead, nor if one
      had his neck broken and the other was poisoned, but&mdash;whose hand was
      that which the mason, Varner, saw that morning, when Brake was flung out
      of that doorway? Come, now!&mdash;whose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not mine, my lad!" answered Folliot, confidently. "That's a fact?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce hesitated, giving Folliot a searching look. And Folliot nodded
      solemnly. "I tell you, not mine!" he repeated. "I'd naught to do with it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then who had?" demanded Bryce. "Was it the other man&mdash;Flood? And if
      so, who is Flood?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Folliot got up from his chair and, cigar between his lips and hands under
      the tails of his old coat, walked silently about the quiet room for
      awhile. He was evidently thinking deeply, and Bryce made no attempt to
      disturb him. Some minutes went by before Folliot took the cigar from his
      lips and leaning against the chimneypiece looked fixedly at his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here, my lad!" he said, earnestly. "You're no doubt, as you say, a
      good hand at finding things out, and you've doubtless done a good bit of
      ferreting, and done it well enough in your own opinion. But there's one
      thing you can't find out, and the police can't find out either, and that's
      the precise truth about Braden's death. I'd no hand in it&mdash;it
      couldn't be fastened on to me, anyhow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce looked up and interjected one word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Collishaw?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor that, neither," answered Folliot, hastily. "Maybe I know something
      about both, but neither you nor the police nor anybody could fasten me to
      either matter! Granting all you say to be true, where's the positive
      truth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about circumstantial evidence," asked Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd have a job to get it," retorted Folliot. "Supposing that all you
      say is true about&mdash;about past matters? Nothing can prove&mdash;nothing!&mdash;that
      I ever met Braden that morning. On the other hand, I can prove, easily,
      that I never did meet him; I can account for every minute of my time that
      day. As to the other affair&mdash;not an ounce of direct evidence!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then&mdash;it was the other man!" exclaimed Bryce. "Now then, who is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Folliot replied with a shrewd glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man who by giving away another man gave himself away would be a damned
      fool!" he answered. "If there is another man&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As if there must be!" interrupted Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then he's safe!" concluded Folliot. "You'll get nothing from me about
      him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And nobody can get at you except through him?" asked Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's about it," assented Folliot laconically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce laughed cynically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A pretty coil!" he said with a sneer. "Here! You talked about my price.
      I'm quite content to hold my tongue if you'd tell me something about what
      happened seventeen years ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" asked Folliot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You knew Brake, you must have known his family affairs," said Bryce.
      "What became of Brake's wife and children when he went to prison?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Folliot shook his head, and it was plain to Bryce that his gesture of
      dissent was genuine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're wrong," he answered. "I never at any time knew anything of Brake's
      family affairs. So little indeed, that I never even knew he was married."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce rose to his feet and stood staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" he exclaimed. "You mean to tell me that, even now, you don't know
      that Brake had two children, and that&mdash;that&mdash;oh, it's
      incredible!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's incredible?" asked Folliot. "What are you talking about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce in his eagerness and surprise grasped Folliot's arm and shook it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good heavens, man!" he said. "Those two wards of Ransford's are Brake's
      girl and boy! Didn't you know that, didn't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never!" answered Folliot. "Never! And who's Ransford, then? I never heard
      Brake speak of any Ransford! What game is all this? What&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Bryce could reply, Folliot suddenly started, thrust his companion
      aside and went to one of the windows. A sharp exclamation from him took
      Bryce to his side. Folliot lifted a shaking hand and pointed into the
      garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There!" he whispered. "Hell and&mdash;What's this mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce looked in the direction pointed out. Behind the pergola of rambler
      roses the figures of men were coming towards the old well-house led by one
      of Folliot's gardeners. Suddenly they emerged into full view, and in front
      of the rest was Mitchington and close behind him the detective, and behind
      him&mdash;Glassdale!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI. THE OTHER MAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was close on five o'clock when Glassdale, leaving Folliot at his garden
      door, turned the corner into the quietness of the Precincts. He walked
      about there a while, staring at the queer old houses with eyes which saw
      neither fantastic gables nor twisted chimneys. Glassdale was thinking. And
      the result of his reflections was that he suddenly exchanged his idle
      sauntering for brisker steps and walked sharply round to the
      police-station, where he asked to see Mitchington.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington and the detective were just about to walk down to the
      railway-station to meet Ransford, in accordance with his telegram. At
      sight of Glassdale they went back into the inspector's office. Glassdale
      closed the door and favoured them with a knowing smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something else for you, inspector!" he said. "Mixed up a bit with last
      night's affair, too. About these mysteries&mdash;Braden and Collishaw&mdash;I
      can tell you one man who's in them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who, then?" demanded Mitchington.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glassdale went a step nearer to the two officials and lowered his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The man who's known here as Stephen Folliot," he answered. "That's a
      fact!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense!" exclaimed Mitchington. Then he laughed incredulously. "Can't
      believe it!" he continued. "Mr. Folliot! Must be some mistake!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No mistake," replied Glassdale. "Besides, Folliot's only an assumed name.
      That man is really one Falkiner Wraye, the man Braden, or Brake, was
      seeking for many a year, the man who cheated Brake and got him into
      trouble. I tell you it's a fact! He's admitted it, or as good as done so,
      to me just now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To you? And&mdash;let you come away and spread it?" exclaimed
      Mitchington. "That's incredible! more astonishing than the other!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Glassdale laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, but I let him think I could be squared, do you see?" he said.
      "Hush-money, you know. He's under the impression that I'm to go back to
      him this evening to settle matters. I knew so much&mdash;identified him,
      as a matter of fact&mdash;that he'd no option. I tell you he's been in at
      both these affairs&mdash;certain! But&mdash;there's another man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who's he?" demanded Mitchington.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't say, for I don't know, though I've an idea he'll be a fellow that
      Brake was also wanting to find," replied Glassdale. "But anyhow, I know
      what I'm talking about when I tell you of Folliot. You'd better do
      something before he suspects me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington glanced at the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come with us down to the station," he said. "Dr. Ransford's coming in on
      this express from town; he's got news for us. We'd better hear that first.
      Folliot!&mdash;good Lord!&mdash;who'd have believed or even dreamed it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll see," said Glassdale as they went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe Dr. Ransford's got the same information." Ransford was out of the
      train as soon as it ran in, and hurried to where Mitchington and his
      companions were standing. And behind him, to Mitchington's surprise, came
      old Simpson Harker, who had evidently travelled with him. With a silent
      gesture Mitchington beckoned the whole party into an empty waiting-room
      and closed its door on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now then, inspector," said Ransford without preface or ceremony, "you've
      got to act quickly! You got my wire&mdash;a few words will explain it. I
      went up to town this morning in answer to a message from the bank where
      Braden lodged his money when he returned to England. To tell you the
      truth, the managers there and myself have, since Braden's death, been
      carrying to a conclusion an investigation which I began on Braden's behalf&mdash;though
      he never knew of it&mdash;years ago. At the bank I met Mr. Harker here,
      who had called to find something out for himself. Now I'll sum things up
      in a nutshell: for years Braden, or Brake, had been wanting to find two
      men who cheated him. The name of one is Wraye, of the other, Flood. I've
      been trying to trace them, too. At last we've got them. They're in this
      town, and without doubt the deaths of both Braden and Collishaw are at
      their door! You know both well enough. Wraye is-"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Folliot!" interrupted Mitchington, pointing to Glassdale. "So he's
      just told us; he's identified him as Wraye. But the other&mdash;who's he,
      doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford glanced at Glassdale as if he wished to question him, but instead
      he answered Mitchington's question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The other man," he said, "the man Flood, is also a well-known man to you.
      Fladgate!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington started, evidently more astonished than by the first news.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" he exclaimed. "The verger! You don't say!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you remember," continued Ransford, "that Folliot got Fladgate his
      appointment as verger not so very long after he himself came here? He did,
      anyway, and Fladgate is Flood. We've traced everything through Flood.
      Wraye has been a difficult man to trace, because of his residence abroad
      for a long time and his change of name, and so on, and it was only
      recently that my agents struck on a line through Flood. But there's the
      fact. And the probability is that when Braden came here he recognized and
      was recognized by these two, and that one or other of them is responsible
      for his death and for Collishaw's too. Circumstantial evidence, all of it,
      no doubt, but irresistible! Now, what do you propose to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington considered matters for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fladgate first, certainly," he said. "He lives close by here; we'll go
      round to his cottage. If he sees he's in a tight place he may let things
      out. Let's go there at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      He led the whole party out of the station and down the High Street until
      they came to a narrow lane of little houses which ran towards the Close.
      At its entrance a policeman was walking his beat. Mitchington stopped to
      exchange a few words with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This man Fladgate," he said, rejoining the others, "lives alone&mdash;fifth
      cottage down here. He'll be about having his tea; we shall take him by
      surprise." Presently the group stood around a door at which Mitchington
      knocked gently, and it was on their grave and watchful faces that a tall,
      clean-shaven, very solemn-looking man gazed in astonishment as he opened
      the door, and started back. He went white to the lips and his hand fell
      trembling from the latch as Mitchington strode in and the rest crowded
      behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now then, Fladgate!" said Mitchington, going straight to the point and
      watching his man narrowly, while the detective approached him closely on
      the other side. "I want you and a word with you at once. Your real name is
      Flood! What have you to say to that? And&mdash;it's no use beating about
      the bush&mdash;what have you to say about this Braden affair, and your
      share with Folliot in it, whose real name is Wraye. It's all come out
      about the two of you. If you've anything to say, you'd better say it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The verger, whose black gown lay thrown across the back of a chair, looked
      from one face to another with frightened eyes. It was very evident that
      the suddenness of the descent had completely unnerved him. Ransford's
      practised eyes saw that he was on the verge of a collapse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give him time, Mitchington," he said. "Pull yourself together," he added,
      turning to the man. "Don't be frightened; answer these questions!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For God's sake, gentlemen!" grasped the verger. "What&mdash;what is it?
      What am I to answer? Before God, I'm as innocent as&mdash;as any of you&mdash;about
      Mr. Brake's death! Upon my soul and honour I am!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know all about it;" insisted Mitchington.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, now, isn't it true that you're Flood, and that Folliot's Wraye, the
      two men whose trick on him got Brake convicted years ago? Answer that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Flood looked from one side to the other. He was leaning against his
      tea-table, set in the middle of his tidy living room. From the hearth his
      kettle sent out a pleasant singing that sounded strangely in contrast with
      the grim situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that's true," he said at last. "But in that affair I&mdash;I wasn't
      the principal. I was only&mdash;only Wraye's agent, as it were: I wasn't
      responsible. And when Mr. Brake came here, when I met him that morning&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, still looking from one to another of his audience as if
      entreating their belief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As sure as I'm a living man, gentlemen!" he suddenly burst out, "I'd no
      willing hand in Mr. Brake's death! I'll tell you the exact truth; I'll
      take my oath of it whenever you like. I'd have been thankful to tell, many
      a time, but for&mdash;for Wraye. He wouldn't let me at first, and
      afterwards it got complicated. It was this way. That morning&mdash;when
      Mr. Brake was found dead&mdash;I had occasion to go up into that gallery
      under the clerestory. I suddenly came on him face to face. He recognized
      me. And&mdash;I'm telling you the solemn, absolute truth, gentlemen!&mdash;he'd
      no sooner recognized me than he attacked me, seizing me by the arm. I
      hadn't recognized him at first, I did when he laid hold of me. I tried to
      shake him off, tried to quiet him; he struggled&mdash;I don't know what he
      wanted to do&mdash;he began to cry out&mdash;it was a wonder he wasn't
      heard in the church below, and he would have been only the organ was being
      played rather loudly. And in the struggle he slipped&mdash;it was just by
      that open doorway&mdash;and before I could do more than grasp at him, he
      shot through the opening and fell! It was sheer, pure accident, gentlemen!
      Upon my soul, I hadn't the least intention of harming him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And after that?" asked Mitchington, at the end of a brief silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw Mr. Folliot&mdash;Wraye," continued Flood. "Just afterwards, that
      was. I told him; he bade me keep silence until we saw how things went.
      Later he forced me to be silent. What could I do? As things were, Wraye
      could have disclaimed me&mdash;I shouldn't have had a chance. So I held my
      tongue."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, then, Collishaw?" demanded Mitchington. "Give us the truth about
      that. Whatever the other was, that was murder!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Flood lifted his hand and wiped away the perspiration that had gathered on
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before God, gentlemen!" he answered. "I know no more&mdash;at least,
      little more&mdash;about that than you do! I'll tell you all I do know.
      Wraye and I, of course, met now and then and talked about this. It got to
      our ears at last that Collishaw knew something. My own impression is that
      he saw what occurred between me and Mr. Brake&mdash;he was working
      somewhere up there. I wanted to speak to Collishaw. Wraye wouldn't let me,
      he bade me leave it to him. A bit later, he told me he'd squared Collishaw
      with fifty pounds&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington and the detective exchanged looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wraye&mdash;that's Folliot&mdash;paid Collishaw fifty pounds, did he?"
      asked the detective.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He told me so," replied Flood. "To hold his tongue. But I'd scarcely
      heard that when I heard of Collishaw's sudden death. And as to how that
      happened, or who&mdash;who brought it about&mdash;upon my soul, gentlemen,
      I know nothing! Whatever I may have thought, I never mentioned it to Wraye&mdash;never!
      I&mdash;I daren't! You don't know what a man Wraye is! I've been under his
      thumb most of my life and&mdash;and what are you going to do with me,
      gentlemen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington exchanged a word or two with the detective, and then, putting
      his head out of the door beckoned to the policeman to whom he had spoken
      at the end of the lane and who now appeared in company with a
      fellow-constable. He brought both into the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get your tea," he said sharply to the verger. "These men will stop with
      you&mdash;you're not to leave this room." He gave some instructions to the
      two policemen in an undertone and motioned Ransford and the others to
      follow him. "It strikes me," he said, when they were outside in the narrow
      lane, "that what we've just heard is somewhere about the truth. And now
      we'll go on to Folliot's&mdash;there's a way to his house round here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Folliot was out, Sackville Bonham was still where Bryce had left him,
      at the golf-links, when the pursuers reached Folliot's. A parlourmaid
      directed them to the garden; a gardener volunteered the suggestion that
      his master might be in the old well-house and showed the way. And Folliot
      and Bryce saw them coming and looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glassdale!" exclaimed Bryce. "By heaven, man!&mdash;he's told on you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Folliot was still staring through the window. He saw Ransford and Harker
      following the leading figures. And suddenly he turned to Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've no hand in this?" he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I?" exclaimed Bryce. "I never knew till just now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Folliot pointed to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go down!" he said. "Let 'em in, bid 'em come up! I'll&mdash;I'll settle
      with 'em. Go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryce hurried down to the lower apartment. He was filled with excitement&mdash;an
      unusual thing for him&mdash;but in the midst of it, as he made for the
      outer door, it suddenly struck him that all his schemings and plottings
      were going for nothing. The truth was at hand, and it was not going to
      benefit him in the slightest degree. He was beaten.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that was no time for philosophic reflection; already those outside
      were beating at the door. He flung it open, and the foremost men started
      in surprise at the sight of him. But Bryce bent forward to Mitchington&mdash;anxious
      to play a part to the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's upstairs!" he whispered. "Up there! He'll bluff it out if he can,
      but he's just admitted to me&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchington thrust Bryce aside, almost roughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We know all about that!" he said. "I shall have a word or two for you
      later! Come on, now&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The men crowded up the stairway into Folliot's snuggery, Bryce, wondering
      at the inspector's words and manner, following closely behind him and the
      detective and Glassdale, who led the way. Folliot was standing in the
      middle of the room, one hand behind his back, the other in his pocket. And
      as the leading three entered the place he brought his concealed hand
      sharply round and presenting a revolver at Glassdale fired point-blank at
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not Glassdale who fell. He, wary and watching, started aside as
      he saw Folliot's movement, and the bullet, passing between his arm and
      body, found its billet in Bryce, who fell, with little more than a groan,
      shot through the heart. And as he fell, Folliot, scarcely looking at what
      he had done, drew his other hand from his pocket, slipped something into
      his mouth and sat down in the big chair behind him ... and within a moment
      the other men in the room were looking with horrified faces from one dead
      face to another.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII. THE GUARDED SECRET
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Bryce had left her, Mary Bewery had gone into the house to await
      Ransford's return from town. She meant to tell him of all that Bryce had
      said and to beg him to take immediate steps to set matters right, not only
      that he himself might be cleared of suspicion but that Bryce's intrigues
      might be brought to an end. She had some hope that Ransford would bring
      back satisfactory news; she knew that his hurried visit to London had some
      connection with these affairs; and she also remembered what he had said on
      the previous night. And so, controlling her anger at Bryce and her
      impatience of the whole situation she waited as patiently as she could
      until the time drew near when Ransford might be expected to be seen coming
      across the Close. She knew from which direction he would come, and she
      remained near the dining-room window looking out for him. But six o'clock
      came and she had seen no sign of him; then, as she was beginning to think
      that he had missed the afternoon train she saw him, at the opposite side
      of the Close, talking earnestly to Dick, who presently came towards the
      house while Ransford turned back into Folliot's garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick Bewery came hurriedly in. His sister saw at once that he had just
      heard news which had had a sobering effect on his usually effervescent
      spirits. He looked at her as if he wondered exactly how to give her his
      message.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw you with the doctor just now," she said, using the term by which
      she and her brother always spoke of their guardian. "Why hasn't he come
      home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick came close to her, touching her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say!" he said, almost whispering. "Don't be frightened&mdash;the
      doctor's all right&mdash;but there's something awful just happened. At
      Folliot's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What" she demanded. "Speak out, Dick! I'm not frightened. What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick shook his head as if he still scarcely realized the full significance
      of his news.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's all a licker to me yet!" he answered. "I don't understand it&mdash;I
      only know what the doctor told me&mdash;to come and tell you. Look here,
      it's pretty bad. Folliot and Bryce are both dead!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of herself Mary started back as from a great shock and clutched
      at the table by which they were standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dead!" she exclaimed. "Why&mdash;Bryce was here, speaking to me, not an
      hour ago!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe," said Dick. "But he's dead now. The fact is, Folliot shot him with
      a revolver&mdash;killed him on the spot. And then Folliot poisoned himself&mdash;took
      the same stuff, the doctor said, that finished that chap Collishaw, and
      died instantly. It was in Folliot's old well-house. The doctor was there
      and the police."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does it all mean?" asked Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't know. Except this," added Dick; "they've found out about those
      other affairs&mdash;the Braden and the Collishaw affairs. Folliot was
      concerned in them; and who do you think the other was? You'd never guess!
      That man Fladgate, the verger. Only that isn't his proper name at all. He
      and Folliot finished Braden and Collishaw, anyway. The police have got
      Fladgate, and Folliot shot Bryce and killed himself just when they were
      going to take him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The doctor told you all this?" asked Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," replied Dick. "Just that and no more. He called me in as I was
      passing Folliot's door. He's coming over as soon as he can. Whew! I say,
      won't there be some fine talk in the town! Anyway, things'll be cleared up
      now. What did Bryce want here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind; I can't talk of it, now," answered Mary. She was already
      thinking of how Bryce had stood before her, active and alive, only an hour
      earlier; she was thinking, too, of her warning to him. "It's all too
      dreadful! too awful to understand!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's the doctor coming now," said Dick, turning to the window. "He'll
      tell more."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary looked anxiously at Ransford as he came hastening in. He looked like
      a man who has just gone through a crisis and yet she was somehow conscious
      that there was a certain atmosphere of relief about him, as though some
      great weight had suddenly been lifted. He closed the door and looked
      straight at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dick has told you?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All that you told me," said Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford pulled off his gloves and flung them on the table with something
      of a gesture of weariness. And at that Mary hastened to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't tell any more&mdash;don't say anything&mdash;until you feel able,"
      she said. "You're tired."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" answered Ransford. "I'd rather say what I have to say now&mdash;just
      now! I've wanted to tell both of you what all this was, what it meant,
      everything about it, and until today, until within the last few hours, it
      was impossible, because I didn't know everything. Now I do! I even know
      more than I did an hour ago. Let me tell you now and have done with it.
      Sit down there, both of you, and listen."
    </p>
    <p>
      He pointed to a sofa near the hearth, and the brother and sister sat down,
      looking at him wonderingly. Instead of sitting down himself he leaned
      against the edge of the table, looking down at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall have to tell you some sad things," he said diffidently. "The only
      consolation is that it's all over now, and certain matters are, or can be,
      cleared and you'll have no more secrets. Nor shall I! I've had to keep
      this one jealously guarded for seventeen years! And I never thought it
      could be released as it has been, in this miserable and terrible fashion!
      But that's done now, and nothing can help it. And now, to make everything
      plain, just prepare yourselves to hear something that, at first, sounds
      very trying. The man whom you've heard of as John Braden, who came to his
      death&mdash;by accident, as I now firmly believe&mdash;there in Paradise,
      was, in reality, John Brake&mdash;your father!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford looked at his two listeners anxiously as he told this. But he met
      no sign of undue surprise or emotion. Dick looked down at his toes with a
      little frown, as if he were trying to puzzle something out; Mary continued
      to watch Ransford with steady eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your father&mdash;John Brake," repeated Ransford, breathing more freely
      now that he had got the worst news out. "I must go back to the beginning
      to make things clear to you about him and your mother. He was a close
      friend of mine when we were young men in London; he a bank manager; I,
      just beginning my work. We used to spend our holidays together in
      Leicestershire. There we met your mother, whose name was Mary Bewery. He
      married her; I was his best man. They went to live in London, and from
      that time I did not see so much of them, only now and then. During those
      first years of his married life Brake made the acquaintance of a man who
      came from the same part of Leicestershire that we had met your mother in&mdash;a
      man named Falkiner Wraye. I may as well tell you that Falkiner Wraye and
      Stephen Folliot were one and the same person."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford paused, observing that Mary wished to ask a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long have you known that?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not until today," replied Ransford promptly. "Never had the ghost of a
      notion of it! If I only had known&mdash;but, I hadn't! However, to go back&mdash;this
      man Wraye, who appears always to have been a perfect master of
      plausibility, able to twist people round his little finger, somehow got
      into close touch with your father about financial matters. Wraye was at
      that time a sort of financial agent in London, engaging in various doings
      which, I should imagine, were in the nature of gambles. He was assisted in
      these by a man who was either a partner with him or a very confidential
      clerk or agent, one Flood, who is identical with the man you have known
      lately as Fladgate, the verger. Between them, these two appear to have
      cajoled or persuaded your father at times to do very foolish and
      injudicious things which were, to put it briefly and plainly, the lendings
      of various sums of money as short loans for their transactions. For some
      time they invariably kept their word to him, and the advances were always
      repaid promptly. But eventually, when they had borrowed from him a
      considerable sum&mdash;some thousands of pounds&mdash;for a deal which was
      to be carried through within a couple of days, they decamped with the
      money, and completely disappeared, leaving your father to bear the
      consequences. You may easily understand what followed. The money which
      Brake had lent them was the bank's money. The bank unexpectedly came down
      on him for his balance, the whole thing was found out, and he was
      prosecuted. He had no defence&mdash;he was, of course, technically guilty&mdash;and
      he was sent to penal servitude."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford had dreaded the telling of this but Mary made no sign, and Dick
      only rapped out a sharp question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He hadn't meant to rob the bank for himself, anyway, had he?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no! not at all!" replied Ransford hastily. "It was a bad error of
      judgment on his part, Dick, but he&mdash;he'd relied on these men, more
      particularly on Wraye, who'd been the leading spirit. Well, that was your
      father's sad fate. Now we come to what happened to your mother and
      yourselves. Just before your father's arrest, when he knew that all was
      lost, and that he was helpless, he sent hurriedly for me and told me
      everything in your mother's presence. He begged me to get her and you two
      children right away at once. She was against it; he insisted. I took you
      all to a quiet place in the country, where your mother assumed her maiden
      name. There, within a year, she died. She wasn't a strong woman at any
      time. After that&mdash;well, you both know pretty well what has been the
      run of things since you began to know anything. We'll leave that, it's
      nothing to do with the story. I want to go back to your father. I saw him
      after his conviction. When I had satisfied him that you and your mother
      were safe, he begged me to do my best to find the two men who had ruined
      him. I began that search at once. But there was not a trace of them&mdash;they
      had disappeared as completely as if they were dead. I used all sorts of
      means to trace them&mdash;without effect. And when at last your father's
      term of imprisonment was over and I went to see him on his release, I had
      to tell him that up to that point all my efforts had been useless. I urged
      him to let the thing drop, and to start life afresh. But he was
      determined. Find both men, but particularly Wraye, he would! He refused
      point-blank to even see his children until he had found these men and had
      forced them to acknowledge their misdeeds as regards him, for that, of
      course, would have cleared him to a certain extent. And in spite of
      everything I could say, he there and then went off abroad in search of
      them&mdash;he had got some clue, faint and indefinite, but still there, as
      to Wraye's presence in America, and he went after him. From that time
      until the morning of his death here in Wrychester I never saw him again!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did see him that morning?" asked Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw him, of course, unexpectedly," answered Ransford. "I had been
      across the Close&mdash;I came back through the south aisle of the
      Cathedral. Just before I left the west porch I saw Brake going up the
      stairs to the galleries. I knew him at once. He did not see me, and I
      hurried home much upset. Unfortunately, I think, Bryce came in upon me in
      that state of agitation. I have reason to believe that he began to suspect
      and to plot from that moment. And immediately on hearing of Brake's death,
      and its circumstances, I was placed in a terrible dilemma. For I had made
      up my mind never to tell you two of your father's history until I had been
      able to trace these two men and wring out of them a confession which would
      have cleared him of all but the technical commission of the crime of which
      he was convicted. Now I had not the least idea that the two men were close
      at hand, nor that they had had any hand in his death, and so I kept
      silence, and let him be buried under the name he had taken&mdash;John
      Braden."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford paused and looked at his two listeners as if inviting question or
      comment. But neither spoke, and he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know what happened after that," he continued. "It soon became evident
      to me that sinister and secret things were going on. There was the death
      of the labourer&mdash;Collishaw. There were other matters. But even then I
      had no suspicion of the real truth&mdash;the fact is, I began to have some
      strange suspicions about Bryce and that old man Harker&mdash;based upon
      certain evidence which I got by chance. But, all this time, I had never
      ceased my investigations about Wraye and Flood, and when the bank-manager
      on whom Brake had called in London was here at the inquest, I privately
      told him the whole story and invited his co-operation in a certain line
      which I was then following. That line suddenly ran up against the man
      Flood&mdash;otherwise Fladgate. It was not until this very week, however,
      that my agents definitely discovered Fladgate to be Flood, and that&mdash;through
      the investigations about Flood&mdash;Folliot was found to be Wraye. Today,
      in London, where I met old Harker at the bank at which Brake had lodged
      the money he had brought from Australia, the whole thing was made clear by
      the last agent of mine who has had the searching in hand. And it shows how
      men may easily disappear from a certain round of life, and turn up in
      another years after! When those two men cheated your father out of that
      money, they disappeared and separated&mdash;each, no doubt, with his
      share. Flood went off to some obscure place in the North of England; Wraye
      went over to America. He evidently made a fortune there; knocked about the
      world for awhile; changed his name to Folliot, and under that name married
      a wealthy widow, and settled down here in Wrychester to grow roses! How
      and where he came across Flood again is not exactly clear, but we knew
      that a few years ago Flood was in London, in very poor circumstances, and
      the probability is that it was then when the two men met again. What we do
      know is that Folliot, as an influential man here, got Flood the post which
      he has held, and that things have resulted as they have. And that's all!&mdash;all
      that I need tell you at present. There are details, but they're of no
      importance."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary remained silent, but Dick got up with his hands in his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's one thing I want to know," he said. "Which of those two chaps
      killed my father? You said it was accident&mdash;but was it? I want to
      know about that! Are you saying it was accident just to let things down a
      bit? Don't! I want to know the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe it was accident," answered Ransford. "I listened most carefully
      just now to Fladgate's account of what happened. I firmly believe the man
      was telling the truth. But I haven't the least doubt that Folliot poisoned
      Collishaw&mdash;not the least. Folliot knew that if the least thing came
      out about Fladgate, everything would come out about himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick turned away to leave the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Folliot's done for!" he remarked. "I don't care about him, but I
      wanted to know for certain about the other."
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      When Dick had gone, and Ransford and Mary were left alone, a deep silence
      fell on the room. Mary was apparently deep in thought, and Ransford, after
      a glance at her, turned away and looked out of the window at the sunlit
      Close, thinking of the tragedy he had just witnessed. And he had become so
      absorbed in his thoughts of it that he started at feeling a touch on his
      arm and looking round saw Mary standing at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to say anything now," she said, "about what you have just
      told us. Some of it I had half-guessed, some of it I had conjectured. But
      why didn't you tell me! Before! It wasn't that you hadn't confidence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Confidence!" he exclaimed. "There was only one reason&mdash;I wanted to
      get your father's memory cleared&mdash;as far as possible&mdash;before
      ever telling you anything. I've been wanting to tell you! Hadn't you seen
      that I hated to keep silent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hadn't you seen that I wanted to share all your trouble about it?" she
      asked. "That was what hurt me&mdash;because I couldn't!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ransford drew a long breath and looked at her. Then he put his hands on
      her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mary!" he said. "You&mdash;you don't mean to say&mdash;be plain!&mdash;you
      don't mean that you can care for an old fellow like me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was holding her away from him, but she suddenly smiled and came closer
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must have been very blind not to have seen that for a long time!" she
      answered.
    </p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
